Closed Firefox.\n5. Restarted Firefox.\n6. Typed the URL of a reference image (my desktop wallpaper, actually, although any image works).\n7. Pressed enter to load and view the image in Firefox.\n\n\nActual results:\n\nImage appears dull and unsaturated, pretty much like my monitor before I calibrated it.  Same image file appears fine and more colourful when viewed in any other application, such as Windows Image Viewer, Photoshop, MS Internet Explorer, etc.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nThe ICC profile obviously did not load.  I have tried every setting in gfx.color_management.rendering_intent, also, to try and get this to work, but it was a futile attempt.\n\nI have also tried not specifying the path to the display profile, deleting the line and leaving an empty string, in hope Firefox would use my default monitor profile (same file) but alas, that didn't work either.
