Again, it's an exceptional case, so most people won't see it.\n\nI assume we keep the old files somewhere in a backup directory? Not sure anything can be recovered from corrupted files, but might be a nice thing to do for the advanced users that are willing to recover their files in a manual way, extract URLs from a bookmarks file, or similar. I really have no sense if this is possible or even makes any sense, but keeping old files around makes sense to me.", "time": "2012-03-05T22:12:58Z", "tags": [], "bug_id": 706008, "is_private": false, "creator": "limi@mozilla.com", "count": 1, "id": 6115678, "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "(In reply to Matthew N.
