We *always* perform 2 GCs right after each other. So the 2nd GC has to wait for the first background finalization to end. In my case it has to wait 20ms for every other GC. So the number of GCs not only doubled, but we also have a locking time where we wait for the first GC to finish.\n\nWe need a better way to detect this!", "raw_text": "It seems that GC regressions become a very serious problem now and we have no way of detecting it other than manually look at the GCTIMER output.\nCurrently I see a bad behavior for the v8-splay benchmark in a multithreaded shell on my MBP.
