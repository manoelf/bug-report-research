I have had the following crash occur several times;\n(a) I may have 10 different brower screens open (e.g., e-Bay, US Treasury\nDepartment, etc.)\n(b) a screen becomes \"non-responsive\", i.e., something happens such that a\nserver \"goes down\", so I can't complete my transaction\n(c) Using Alt-Control-Delete - to open \"Task Manager\" to see a list of all\nprograms/windows, -I select the non-responsive Firefox Window, and hit \"End Task\".\n(d) When I close it, all other Firefox windows also close, even those that are\nworking perfectly.\n\nThis is hugely disruptive. I am not an engineer, so have no clue, as to why\nclosing one window via \"Task Manager\" shuts down all others, when closing a\nbrowser with the bottom-of-screen list, does not shut down all others.\n\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.Open up several browser windows, and connect to other sites, e.g., e-Bay, etc.\n2.Hit Alt-Control-Delete to access Task Manager\n3. Select a browser window\n4. Hit \"End Task\" to close that window\n5. All other open browser windows should instantly close.\n\nActual Results:  \nMy blood pressure went up into four digits, as I had to re-connect to about 15\ndifferent websites.\n\nExpected Results:  \nIt should have shut-down the single, non-responsive window, and left the others\nalone.\n\nI had open: MS Word and Excel (Office 1997); Adobe Acrobat 5.0, WordPerfect 10,\nand juno e-mail.
