In the past week if you've been reading bugtraq\nyou will have seen my posts on IE 6 Sp2 URL spoofing.\n\nI was able to recreate the same SPOOF in:\nMozilla(Sorry No Version Number) \nFireFox(Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a5) Gecko/20041019\nFirefox/0.9.1+)\nNetscape(Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.4) Gecko/20030624) \n\nReproducible: Always\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open your browser.\n2. Set the homepage to the following:\n\njavascript:document.write(\"<iframe src='http://www.google.com' width='100%'\nheight='100%' frameborder='0'></iframe>\"), document.close(); \n\n3. Now navigate to any page you like. Just don't go to google as it won't be\nclear that it's being spoofed.\n\n4. Once your site loads up click the home button. The google website will appear\nbut the address will be spoofed to that of the site you was just on.\n\n\nAlso on FireFox when i loaded the browser google appeared but the address was\nabout:blank, i'm not sure if this is the same for Mozilla. Netscape when opened\nwill go to google and display nothing in the address bar.\n\nActual Results:  \n1. Navigated to slashdot.org\n2. Clicked home\n3. Url said slashdot.org but the webpage was google.com\n\n\nExpected Results:  \nExpected to see googles url in the address bar OR filter javascript form being\nentered as a homepage.", "is_private": false, "creator": "andiroohunter@msn.com", "count": 0, "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 265123, "time": "2004-10-19T18:50:10Z", "tags": [], "id": 2299240, "text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a5) Gecko/20041019 Firefox/0.9.1+\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a5) Gecko/20041019 Firefox/0.9.1+\n\nHey, this is \"Andrew Hunter\".
