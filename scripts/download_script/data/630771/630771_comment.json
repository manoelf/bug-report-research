There appears to be a hack in browser.css that allows the Home button to live in the bookmarks toolbar without expanding it.  I propose that this be shared for all buttons.  All toolbar buttons (small icons mode) are set to padding-top:3px and padding-bottom:3px, while the Home button has the added .bookmark-item class and so is rendered with padding-top:2px and padding-button:2px.  The extra padding causes the Bookmarks toolbar to grow from 24px to 26px.  This would also help the menubar which grows from 20px to 26px.  There is already a similar hack in place to reduce the height of buttons in the Addons bar and TabsToolbar.\n\n\n\nReproducible: Always", "id": 5245108, "count": 0, "time": "2011-02-02T03:32:10Z", "creator": "pjdkrunkt@lycos.com", "author": "pjdkrunkt@lycos.com", "attachment_id": null, "bug_id": 630771, "raw_text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.0; rv:2.0b11pre) Gecko/20110201 Firefox/4.0b11pre\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.0; rv:2.0b11pre) Gecko/20110201 Firefox/4.0b11pre\n\nWith the exception of the Home button, all other toolbar buttons cause the Bookmarks toolbar to grow taller.
