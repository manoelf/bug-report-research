The relevant styles here are:\n\n  .accessory_item {\n    height: 190px;\n    margin: 0 10px 10px 0;\n    position: relative;\n   -webkit-transition: all 0.8s ease-in-out;\n   -moz-transition: all 0.8s ease-in-out;\n   -o-transition: all 0.8s ease-in-out;\n  }\n  .accessory_item:hover {\n    top: -240px;\n    height: 430px;\n    margin-bottom: -240px;\n  }\n\nWhen the item is hovered, the transitions start.  Height at this point is still 190px and the bottom margin is still 10px, but the top value becomes -240px _immediately_ because the value is transitioning from \"auto\" to \"-240px\" and bug 571344 bites us.  So at that point the box moves up by 240px but is still only 190px tall and is no longer hovered, so the transition reverses, etc.\n\nIt looks like WebKit and Opera sort of support transitioning from \"auto\" to a length for box offsets by treating \"auto\" as 0 when interpolating.  It gives broken behavior in most abs pos cases, but works correctly for rel pos.\n\nDavid, is there more here than just a duplicate of bug 571344?\n\nChris, if this is your site you can work around this in the meantime by adding:\n\n  top: 0;\n\nto the .accessory_item styles so that the transition is explicitly between 0 and -240px.", "text": "So this is an interesting case.
