Let's start with a non-automated test, just to verify functionality, and then move to an automated one (if we can). Here's what I'd recommend you do:\n\nCreate two animated images (.gif is fine). Each of these should have 2 frames - let's make them 100x100px squares. The first frame will have a red square, and the second frame will have a blue square. Both of them should specify timeout=0 (meaning there is a 0-ms time between frame 1 and frame 2).

For the non-automated versions, you're looking for two things: 1) that the looping image doesn't use 100% of the CPU (or some strange, very high amount, either), and 2) that the non-looping image stays on the last frame (the blue frame) indefinitely. \n\nI usually use The Gimp to create images like this - www.gimp.org.\n\nAlso, you'll need to specify your hg username and a commit comment when the patch is ready. Commit messages should be in the form:\n\nBug XXXXXX: <description of what you changed and why> r=<reviewer>\n\nYou can change this by pushing your patch and then running: \nhg qref -m \"<commit message>\n\nThis will save it to your patch, so you don't need to do it every time.
