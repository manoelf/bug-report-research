The\nidea is that if you click on any of the navigation links on top, it'll load the\ntarget using Ajax and show a smooth transition animation ala iPhone before\ndisplaying the new content.\n\nIf you open index.html and click on \"book.txt\", MainController.showNewContent()\nwill be called which executes two animations using $.fn.transition() which in turn uses CSS transitions and CSS transformations. One moves\nthe old content pane to the left until it's no longer visible, the other one\nmoves the new content pane to the center, to the place where the old content\npane was. This test case works perfectly on Chrome, Safari and Opera, but on\nFirefox 4.0 the first click doesn't work properly because the transitionend\nevent isn't fired. The second click works, but the third one doesn't, etc.\n\nReproducible: Always", "attachment_id": null, "id": 5429390, "raw_text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_7; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/10.0.648.205 Safari/534.16\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\n\nI have a test case here: http://izumi.plan99.net/firefox-transitionend-bug.tar.gz\nThis test case uses AJAX so it should be put on a web server.\n\nThis test case was an exercise for me in Spine.js and CSS transformations.
