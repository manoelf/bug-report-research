Just to be clear, there's never any losing historical events when we stop sending to Amplitude; we can always pick back up where we left off if you need them. In general if you're not using Amplitude day-to-day right now, I might recommend we stop sending so that we can reduce our Amplitude usage. If you have a specific need that comes up for Focus I can certainly help you make a query for it.\n\nDoes that sound acceptable to you?", "id": 14776795, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "fbertsch@mozilla.com", "creation_time": "2020-04-24T17:21:18Z", "count": 2, "is_private": false, "bug_id": 1632629, "tags": [], "author": "fbertsch@mozilla.com", "time": "2020-04-24T17:21:18Z", "raw_text": "(In reply to athomas from comment #1)\n> Hi Frank, we're due to investigate next steps on Focus.
