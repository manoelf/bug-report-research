at:\ntools->add-ons->languages->Japanese Language Pack 2.0.0.1\nhowever, websites with japanese text (chinese characters) are not displaying as expected.  instead of the kanji (chinese characters), there are small boxes with 4 small characters inside towards each corner.\n\ni attempted to 'reinstall' the JLP by visiting the following site and selecting 'install':\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3846\nchecking, i see this included at:\nfirefox->tools->add-ons->extensions->JLP kit 0.2.8.1.\n\nfirefox was restarted.  however, the japanese (chinese) characters are displaying as boxes as before.\n\nbefore we upgraded to fc5/2.0.0.1, we had fc2 with firefox 1.5.0.3, which appears to load the above urls as expected (interestingly enough, not in the title bar of the browser window, however, as in the amazon page's case).\n\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. start up firefox 2.0.0.1 on linux fc5 2.6.18\n\n2. note that the extensions list include JLP 2.0.0.1/install JLP 0.2.8.1 from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3846\n\n3. visit sample urls:\nhttp://www.amazon.co.jp/,

characters), there are small boxes with 4 small numbers and letters inside towards each corner.\n\nExpected Results:  \njapanese kanji (chinese characters) as displayed previously on fc2 with firefox
