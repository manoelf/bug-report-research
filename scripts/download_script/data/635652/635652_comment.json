In Firefox, access the URL in this bug report, which contains a certificate bundle with several certificates.  When the \"Downloading Certificate\" dialog appears, click the \"View\" button.  This will show the details of the first certificate in the bundle.  However, the user interface should allow the user to see the details of ALL of the certificates in the bundle, perhaps by using \"Next\" and \"Previous\" buttons to flip between them.\n\n2. Continuing with the previous step: click OK to return to the \"Downloading Certificate\" dialog, then check all of the boxes and click OK.  There is one invalid certificate in the bundle, so an alert will appear that reads, \"This certificate can't be verified and will not be imported.\"  However the alert does not indicate which certificate in the bundle was not imported. The alert text should be changed to include the certificate name.\n\n3. Continuing with the previous step: click OK on the alert.  The import operation is complete.  It may seem to the user as though it completely failed, since an alert appeared, but in fact five certificates were imported successfully.  A dialog box should appear now, stating the number of certificates that were imported successfully, or the names of the certificates that were imported successfully.", "creator": "david.ward@ll.mit.edu", "bug_id": 635652, "text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101206 Ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) Firefox/3.6.13\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101206 Ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) Firefox/3.6.13\n\nThe user interface needs to be improved when importing a certificate bundle (a file that contains multiple certificates, such as the one found at URL in this bug).\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
