FF allows to click it pretty fast (as js assigned - each click reloads the page) but it can't control the amount and if i see 27 (for example) on the screen it actually changes back to let's say 20 beacause tracking was lost because of the page reload. I tested the same situation in IE browser. It works perfectly even if page reloads and if i clicked 27 times it will actually display 27 when page refreshed for the last time.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Assign amount (keep in session or db)\n2. Place it in the text field\n3. Make a button and assign js to increase that amount + assign page reload to save changes (no ajax)\n4. \nActual Results:  \nFF can't track all the clicks i made\n\nExpected Results:  \namount on the screen should match amounts of clicks.\n\nit should track all the clicks (IE does it perfectly)", "count": 0, "creator": "phpcoder@inbox.lv", "creation_time": "2011-01-13T22:00:04Z", "is_private": false, "time": "2011-01-13T22:00:04Z", "text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; ru; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; ru; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13\n\nThere is a \"+\" button on my web page to increase amount of products to buy (in the cart).
