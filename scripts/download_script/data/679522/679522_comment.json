I think it would be nice to do this on .info and .simpleMeasurements. In this example i used appID. Once one filters on appID, distributions for .version, .appname, .OS, etc should update accordingly. One should then be able to filter on them as described.\n\nSorry for the crappy mockup, I do not make my living from UI design.", "author": "taras.mozilla@glek.net", "creator": "taras.mozilla@glek.net", "tags": [], "raw_text": "(In reply to Pedro Alves from comment #3)\n> I actually have the same doubt as daniel.
