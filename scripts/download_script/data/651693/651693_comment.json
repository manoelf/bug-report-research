Hooking up the shorthand to the font-variant-xxx subproperties needs to wait until the spec is in PR I think. At a minimum the fallback behavior for small-caps needs to be implemented so that existing use of font-variant: small-caps does not rely on the existence of small-cap variants. Put in other words, all browsers currently \"fallback\" when 'small-caps' is specified. The 'font-variant-caps' property currently only enables the OpenType small-caps feature, it doesn't implement the fallback to synthetic small-caps for fonts that lack small caps alternates.\n\nBug 747849 is the beginning of this work.", "author": "jd.bugzilla@gmail.com", "raw_text": "(In reply to Florian Bender from comment #1)\n> Is there a bug for the font-variant shorthand?
