It still occurs when I disable all addons and plugins. Basically I have lots of tabs open (which is very often for me) and the left and right arrow buttons that are used to scroll through the tabs do not work, or work very intermittently. Also using the scroller on the mouse doesn't work. \n\nI actually had a new bit of information just now. I had the Error Console open while working on something else and noticed 2 errors that came up whenever I tried to click one of the left/right tab scroll buttons. Here is the error:\n\nError: uncaught exception: [Exception... \"Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE) [nsIDOMWindow.mozRequestAnimationFrame]\"  nsresult: \"0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)\"  location: \"JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/scrollbox.xml :: arrowSmoothScroll_start :: line 648\"  data: no]\n\nError: uncaught exception: [Exception... \"Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE) [nsIDOMWindow.mozRequestAnimationFrame]\"  nsresult: \"0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)\"  location: \"JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/scrollbox.xml :: scrollAnim_start :: line 283\"  data: no]\n\nI can use the Ctrl-Tab key combo to go to the next tab but still the tab strip doesn't move so that I'm sometimes on a tab that isn't actually showing at the top. It's very annoying.\n\nWhenever I use the key combo, I still get an error - it's just the second error I copied above. So it seems like when I use the key combo, there is a failure in scrollAnim_start, and when I use the arrow button there is a failure in both that and arrowSmoothScroll_start.\n\nHow to repeat - open lots of tabs so that they don't all fit at the top, then try to scroll left and right through the tab strip.  I often use the middle click of the mouse to open a link in a new tab but I doubt that has anything to do with it.\n\nFirefox version 12.0 but I believe this has occurred through several updates.", "creation_time": "2012-06-15T14:37:17Z", "is_private": false, "tags": [], "time": "2012-06-15T14:37:17Z", "count": 2, "raw_text": "I have had this problem bug me for quite a while.
