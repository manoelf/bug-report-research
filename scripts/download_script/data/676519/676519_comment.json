We just need to decide how to handle the case of input elements which are not text controls somehow.  The current way that we do this is sucky and makes my eyes bleed every time that I read nsHTMLInputElement.cpp.  WebKit also does something like this (they have a class called HTMLTextFormControlElement).  I wish there was a better way for modeling this in C++ :(", "creator": "ehsan.akhgari@gmail.com", "raw_text": "(In reply to Mounir Lamouri (:volkmar) from comment #1)\n> I guess we could have a nsTextControlElement class that would inherit from\n> nsITextControlElement and actually implement it. nsHTMLInputElement and\n> nsHTMLTextAreaElement would inherit from nsTextControlElement instead of\n> nsITextControlElement.\n> Does that make sense?\n\nYeah.
