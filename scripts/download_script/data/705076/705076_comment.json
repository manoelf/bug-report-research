Open 2 separate Firefox (FF) windows\n2. Put them side-by-side (or top-to-bottom) so they don't overlap and are both fully visible on the screen\n3. Navigate to long page to provide scrollable scrollbars in each window\n4. Focus window 1 (#1)\n5. Click and hold down (drag) the scrollbar thumb in window 2 (#2)\n6. Attempt to scroll by moving the mouse while dragging\n\n\nActual results:\n\nNothing: no scroll happens, no drag event appears to have happened.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nThumb should move, window should scroll.\n\nThis same test works fine if using any other app with a scrollbar, like a gnome-terminal, it appears specific to FF (not tested on other Mozilla apps).  Thus I am doubtful this is a wm issue.\n\nStranger still, this test works fine if #1 is FF and #2 is any other app (and vice versa)!  This strange behaviour only occurs between 2 FF windows.\n\nSingle-click events do work ok, even between 2 FF windows and even on the scrollbar.  It is only drag (probably mouse-down) events that are broken.\n\nThis bug applies to all dragging events, and can be demonstrated by attempting a left-drag across page content to highlight text instead of trying to use the scrollbar.\n\nThis worked perfectly fine in Fedora 14 with Firefox 3.6.", "tags": [], "raw_text": "User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1\nBuild ID: 20110930134223\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nOn Fedora 16 (linux), sawfish wm, XFCE4 desktop, click-to-focus\n\n1.
