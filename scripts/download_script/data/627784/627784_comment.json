Note that this node is drawn after the gray bar.  When the map overflows the gray bar, clicking on the bar appears to activate the map mousedown event handler even though the map was 'hidden' and not drawn over the bar.  The bar itself disappears and the map shows through.  This does not happen in Chrome/Opera/Safari.\n\nNow, one can say click on the small inset world map on Alaska.  This moves the big map down so that it shows Alaska.  In this position, it no longer overflows onto the gray bar.  Now if I click on the gray bar, nothing happens which is what is suppose to happen.  This indicates to me that while Firefox correctly DREW the map and clipped it, it did not CLIP the mousedown event sensing area.  This is my guess at the issue.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.See details.
