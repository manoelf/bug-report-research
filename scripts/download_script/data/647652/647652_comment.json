I did in fact misread your comment and thought you were implying it was not possible to set dupe_of.\n\nYes it is true that dupe_of is not part of Bug.fields due to the way it is currently implemented. Bug.fields pulls the list of fields from a database table and dupe_of is not currently part of that table.\n\nBug.get is using returning a custom list of values for a bug report and has nothing to do with the same table of the database unfortunately.\n\nIt is possible that Bug.fields needs to be reworked in that it just returns the same possible fields that Bug.get returns as a client will not care about the extra field names from Bug.fields if they can't even possible be returned by Bug.get.
