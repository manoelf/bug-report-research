Don't think I noticed at first but eventually saw the error footer showing up. The \nSync Now button on the footer does no good.\n\nAccording to HTTP Headers I'm getting a \"413 Request Entity Too Large\" response. According to sync-log (attached) the problem is with bookmarks trying to upload in a 12Mb chunk. Thanks to rnewman (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Services/Sync/Snippets) we pinned this on a single 9.3Mb bookmark (added when testing bug 607524)\n\nI've deleted the bookmark and expect my personal problems are likely fixed (but I'll definitely update the bug if not). This bug is more that sync needs to deal with such things in some better way -- chunk into a smaller number of items? Drop items above some threshhold (but watch out that multiple legal items don't add up to more than the server can handle)?\n\nSteps to Reproduce\n 1. Load http://www.thegameisserious.com/testtest.htm\n    (if that's gone load the attachment in bug 607524)\n 2. Bookmark that page once the title is loaded\n 3. Sync will now be hosed.", "count": 0, "author": "dveditz@mozilla.com", "creator": "dveditz@mozilla.com", "tags": [], "raw_text": "Ever since I enabled Sync in this old profile I've been getting Sync errors.
