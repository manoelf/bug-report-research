We globally changed the \"Gap from Edge of Paper to Margin\" settings from the default of .04 to .25 (in /usr/lib/firefox-1.5.0.1/greprefs/all.js).  We then started Firefox using a new profile.\n\nUpon startup, the changed gap settings appear in the File / Print / [Printer] Properties dialog box, but they are not honored.  If, for example, you \"cancel\" that dialog box and print, the header/footer are cut off.  If you go back to the dialog box, and press \"OK\", then the new gap settings take effect.\n\n(note:  This is not quite the same as bug 242134, where users reported having to change this setting each time the browser is started.  When we apply the setting as described above, it remains in effect across browser sessions.)\n\nIn both cases, about:config shows the browser has the following settings:\n\nprint.print_edge_{top,bottom,left,right} 25\n\nOn a browser where the gap settings have been applied, they show up in about:config as follows:\n\nprint.printer_CUPS/InfoSvc.print_edge_{top,bottom,left,right} 25\n\nOn a browser where the gap settings have not been applied, there is a series of config settings of the form:\n\nprint.tmp.printerfeatures.CUPS/InfoSvc.paper.count\n\n(Where InfoSvc is the name of our printer), but no print_edge settings.\n\nHope this makes sense.
