Like many, I'm not always looking at the screen and the notification or balloon  disappears after a while (and with it the icon in the taskbar). Hence it's difficult to tell after a couple of seconds if new mail arrived, e.g., when the mail windows are covered by other windows, and you have to focus the mail window to see if something (or nothing) arrived since last time.\n\nThe workaround I figured is to right-click on the icons in the task bar, select \"Customize notification icons\", and to change the mail icon from \"Only show notifications\" to \"Show icon and notification\". Now it will stay until I actually read a new mail, problem solved, but rather hard to discover.\n\nIn the linked-to tutorial, a registry tweak is mentioned (option #3) to modify that setting, but only globally and not on a per-application basis. Given that the new-mail icon is technically an application icon, but only shown when new mail is actually to be notified about, settings a default to always show icon and notifications for this specific purpose should be justified. The hope is that some Windows 7 registry entry will allow for that, then either on startup or installation the mode for the mail-notification icon could be set if the underlying operating system is identified as Windows 7.", "attachment_id": null, "creator": "rsx11m.pub@gmail.com", "time": "2011-02-16T18:38:21Z", "id": 5283648, "is_private": false, "creation_time": "2011-02-16T18:38:21Z", "bug_id": 634656, "raw_text": "In Windows XP, the new-mail icon stays in the taskbar for both Thunderbird and SeaMonkey.
