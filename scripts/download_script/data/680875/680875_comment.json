Obviously the biggest issue with the rapid release is the change in numbers, which causes a lot of add-ons to break.\n\nWhat I think should be done, and anyone could have other ideas, is that somehow we get rid of the version numbers in add-ons, since chrome does not force a version number on any of it's extensions.\n\nNow, I do realise that extensions are not the same as add-ons, but form the rapid updates, I haven't seen much mention of the change in the add-on system. It might be wise to give add-ons their own version number, maybe relating to gecko and giving a simple guide of what the numbers realate to version numbers, or, since the plan of getting rid of version numbers, what build channel it supports.\n\nSomething has to be done.
