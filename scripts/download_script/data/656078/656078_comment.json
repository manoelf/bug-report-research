Using \"Open All\" on that message gave me a stack of eight \"Open with\" dialogs in parallel, which may be irritating, especially if some attachments are of the same file type (thus, picking an application in the first dialog doesn't propagate to the other dialogs which are already open). Also, focus is lost when the first application opens and moves into the foreground, and to the user there is no indication that further dialogs need to be handled.\n\nSo, it may be beneficial to issue the openAttachment() calls in a more serial way, thus ensuring that any modification in one dialog propagates to the next, and also to allow the operating system to register that a new dialog has been presented and thus take appropriate action (e.g., blinking in the task bar).", "author": "rsx11m.pub@gmail.com", "text": "A minor observation during testing of bug 654912 for a message with several attachments without any handling application having been defined yet.
