When I generate three small files page.html, style.css and script.js, I cannot reproduce the problem with those files, though I see the problem 100% of the time with files in large web applications I work on, on a number of different servers and on apache running locally on my development workstation.   Perhaps there is a size sensitivity in the caching algorithm?\n\n", "time": "2006-05-11T06:16:37Z", "id": 2852770, "tags": [], "creation_time": "2006-05-11T06:16:37Z", "author": "public@lrdesign.com", "is_private": false}, {"tags": [], "creation_time": "2006-05-11T07:26:48Z", "author": "m-wada@usa.com", "is_private": false, "attachment_id": null, "creator": "m-wada@usa.com", "bug_id": 234361, "text": "(In reply to comment #14)\n> 3) Edit something in 'script.js', visit 'page.html', and refresh.

In this case, it was just an example to illustrate the difference between linked js files and linked/included other files (like css).  Other files always refresh correctly when shift-reloading the page that includes them.  js files do not always do so in my experience.\n", "time": "2006-05-11T22:40:54Z", "text": "(In reply to comment #15)\n> (Q1) What is your Firefox build ID?\n\nMine is:\nMozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3\n\nBut, I have observed this behavior in all firefox version I've tried on both Mac and Win anytime in the last year.\n\n>      Problem occurs even when -safe-mode?\n\nUnknown, don't know how to test this.\n\n> (Q2) What is difference between your \"shift+refresh\" and your \"Shift-reload\"\n>      and your \"force-reloading a page\"?\n\nThey are synonymous.
