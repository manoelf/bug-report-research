I am developing on a ColdFusion website, and serving an MP3 file via the CFCONTENT tag.\n\nThe MP3 file is created by the server using the DOS command copy (ie. \"copy -b x.mp3 + y.mp3 xy.mp3\"), so the mp3 files are created using this DOS binary append method; as such I know that the mp3 files may not have the 'correct' headers in the file, but this doesn't seem to matter at all in IE 7 (Windows, using the WMP plugin), Firefox 2 (Windows using the WMP plugin) or Safari (using the QT plugin).\n\nI do not think that the problem is in the mp3 file though, because when I use the same code but reference the SRC to the actual location of the mp3 file, it works fine in all browsers mentioned above and in this problem setup on Mac.\n\nThe URL provided will show the only situation that I have been able to get it to work properly, where the SRC is being changed depending on the browser requesting the page (see the differences in the OBJECT/EMBED tag HTML syntax from the problem browser to any other browser or Firefox on Windows.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create an mp3 file using the DOS copy command (ie. \"copy -b 1.mp3 + 2.mp3 + 3.mp3 + 4.mp3 1234.mp3\")\n2. Use ColdFusion (MX 7.0.2) CFCONTENT to serve the mp3 file to the browser using the object/embed tag pair\n3. View the page using Firefox 2.0.0.3 on Mac.\nActual Results:  \nThe Quicktime plugin appears to play a very small part of the start of the file, but never more than perhaps 1/2 of the file (in my tests).  Most of the time, it only gets a fraction of a second of the file.\n\nExpected Results:  \nIt should just play the mp3 file, but it doesn't.\n\nPlease email me at nate.johnson@staff.azbar.org if you need me to set up any additional test pages or if you are unable to reproduce this issue?  If this is something I need to notify Apple about their Quicktime plugin, please let me know.
