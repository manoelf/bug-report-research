In the application in question, the xul:browser was inside of a xul:stack, and the missing scrollbar would only manifest for the first one.  Subsequently added xul:browsers would have a scrollbar as expected.  Since this seems like it could be a very tricky problem to track down, I constructed a small test app that demonstrates the problem.  This is the scrollbar-test.tar.gz linked above.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Run the XULRunner app contained in scrollbar-test.tar.gz with XULRunner 2.0 or higher.\n2. A window comes up with a single button.  Click that button once.  It will open a new window that contains a single xul:browser, browsing to a page on the mozilla website.  (It may take a moment for the window to come up, since this test app simply uses the 'src' attribute of the xul:browser to load the url.)\n\n\nActual Results:  \nWith XULRunner 2.0 and higher, the xul:browser contains no scrollbar.  When run with a version of XULRunner prior to 2.0, there is a scrollbar.\n\nExpected Results:  \nI expected there to be a scrollbar.", "creation_time": "2011-05-12T01:07:41Z", "raw_text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:6.0a1) Gecko/20110504 conkeror/0.9.3\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla XULRunner 2.0 - 20110304101727\n\nDeveloping a web browser based on XULRunner, I found that with XULRunner 2.0 and later, the first xul:browser element in every newly opened window was missing a scrollbar, even though its content was long enough to require one.
