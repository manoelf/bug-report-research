We can certainly help you with queries, but we won't be able to help day-to-day; i.e. there will be a delay between requests and dashboards.\n\nDoes that sound acceptable to you? Can you also describe what kinds of analyses you'll be doing to determine the future of FFTV?", "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "(In reply to athomas from comment #1)\n> Hi Frank!
