It was incredibly exciting to see how an image (e.g. a screenshot) that actually physically _pixel-perfectly_ fits into my monitor's space (especially a 4K image on a 4K monitor), is either scaled down (and therefore blurred without a reason) by just 1-2 pixels (by default) or causing scrollbars to appear (when clicked) in Firefox.\n\nIn fact, the bug can be fixed extremely trivially by just replacing the following CSS rule in the \"browser\\omni.ja\\chrome\\browser\\content\\browser\\browser.css\" file:\n\n    #fullscr-toggler {\n      height: 1px;\n      background: black;\n

the 1-pixel top line of content (e.g. image) _invisible_ due to overlapping the content by a 1-pixel black line.\n\nFor now, I've already fixed the bug for myself locally with the following rule in my user stylesheet (via the Stylish extension):\n\n    #fullscr-toggler {\n        background: none !important;\n        position: fixed !important;\n        width: 100% !important;\n    }", "tags": [],
