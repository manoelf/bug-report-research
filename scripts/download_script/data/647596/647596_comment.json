If I select \"Save\" the statement is placed into my Downloads Folder.  Double Clicking on it causes it to open using Mac's Preview.  It is correct at that point.  If I then save it to my MacBook Pro it is immediately rendered in Preview displaying the file name I used, but with blank spaces in place of all of the lower case \"o\" characters. This has been confirmed by another Mac user relative to his Verizon Wireless Statements.\n**\nIf instead I access the Verizon site via Safari Version 5.0.2 (6533.18.5) the statement is rendered correctly in Safari, and the .pdf can be saved to my Mac's local file system from Safari.  When the version of the .pdf saved by Safari is subsequently opened, it is rendered correctly, including all of its lower case \"o\" characters.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Some Bugzilla team member who uses a Verizon Cell phone should access his monthly statement via Firefox 4.0 on a Mac by starting at the URL provided above.\n2. Under \"My Bill\" he should click on \"View, Print and Pay My Bill\"\n3. At the next page presented he should \"Sign In to My Verizon\" by entering Cell Phone Number and Password, then selecting \"Sign In\"\n4. Billing Statement page is then shown.  Select \"Print Bill\"\n5. A pop-up dialog box then appears, labeled \"Opening Statement.pdf\"  Per the dialog box: \"You have chosen to open   statement.pdf  which is a: Portable Document Format from: https://ebillpay.verizonwireless.com\"\n6. Select the Radio Button labeled \"Save File\", then click \"OK\".\n7. The Downloads window will be presented, with the gererated statement as the latest download.  In my latest test case it is:   statement(3).pdf   89.2 KB -- verizon wireless.com\n8. Double click on the statement.pdf entry in the Downloads window.  \n9. The statement opens in Preview, and is rendered correctly.\n10. In Preview, select File->Save-As and save the .pdf of the statement somewhere in the user's Documents Folder with an identifiable name.\n11. Use Finder to find the saved statement in the User's Documents Folder and double click on it.\n12. The .pdf of the statement will open in \"Preview\" \n13. Inspect the statement and observe that a space is rendered in place of each lower case \"o\"\nActual Results:  \nEach instance of a lower case \"o\" is rendered as a space when the saved copy of the .pdf is opened via Preview.  If the saved statement is opened with Acrobat Reader 9.4.3 instead, the same problem occurs, lower case \"o\" characters are not rendered.\nCanned .pdf documents, however, such as specification sheets downloaded via Firefox 4.0 from commercial sites, do not exhibit the problem.\n\nExpected Results:  \nThe same, since this always happens.  Better would be to render the lower case \"o\" characters where they should occur.\n\nMy Mac's \"Preview\" is Version 5.0.2 (504)\nThis behavior was the same before and after updating a Firefox Extension, the SnagIt Autoscrolling Helper on my Mac, from Ver. 1.0 to 1.1\nThe only other Firefox Extension I have on my Mac is Garmin Communicator 2.9.3\nFirefox Appearance:  Default 4.0\nFirefox Plugins on my Mac:\n* Garmin Communicator Plug-in Version 2.9.3.0  2.9.3.0 Release\n* Google Earth Plug-in 5.2\n* iPhotoPhotocast 7.0\n* Java Plug-In 2 for NPAPI Browers 13.3.0\n* QuickTime Plug-In 7.6.6  7.6.6\n* Shockwave Flash 10.2.152.33", "creation_time": "2011-04-03T19:50:04Z", "text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\n\nAccessing my monthly statement from Verizon Wireless via Firefox 4.0 using the \"View, Print and Pay My Bill\" link, then selecting \"Print\" causes the Verizon site to generate a .pdf of the statement.
