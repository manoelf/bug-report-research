You can only run one copy of firefox at a time unless you include the -no-remote switch to the executable and select a different profile. By default, a new installation does not append this switch; you have to add it manually by editing the shortcut or running from command line.", "creation_time": "2012-03-10T17:00:08Z", "raw_text": "(In reply to Ben Thompson from comment #4)\n> I was able to \"reproduce\" it (Windows 7 64) by having an existing\n> installation of Firefox running already during install.
