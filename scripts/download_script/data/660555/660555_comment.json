Queries of huge mailboxes can be done in moments.\n\nExisting functionality of Dovecot + Solr (and others) provides for a full text search of bodies, headers, or any combination.  The Thunderbird Quick Search uses a server-side IMAP query for body searches - but does not do so for headers.  Possible changes include:\n\n1.  Add a button in the Quick Search widget for \"Server-Side Headers\".\n2.  Add a checkbox in the Quck Search widget for \"Server-Side Searching\".\n3.  Add an option under Accounts/Server Settings to enable Server-Side Header searching.\n\nMuch of Thunderbird seems to be geared towards offline reading - yet many users prefer using Thunderbird as an on-line IMAP reader.  It would be extremely beneficial to see support for more server-side features, instead of trying to implement them solely in the client.\n\nReproducible: Always", "time": "2011-05-29T20:55:00Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1\nBuild Identifier: 3.1.10\n\nLike clients, IMAP servers have continued to develop and add functionality.
