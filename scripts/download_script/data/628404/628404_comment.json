The (optional) customizable toolbar button (#sync-button) size and margins don't fit well with the existing toolbar icons, esp. with the bigger size (32x32 vs 30x30). Firefox uses different artwork now, so maybe checking pinstripe is worth a try.\n\n2. When all windows are closed, there's an error message (see below) because the initial implementation doesn't cope with the Mac-specific hidden window case (the observer element referred to by the error message is contained in tasksOverlay.xul).
