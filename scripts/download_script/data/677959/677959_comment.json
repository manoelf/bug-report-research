This is a post request, so I expected there will be no caching. But still, it seems the first request was cached, and the second request was taken from the cache. I even tried to add the onsubmit part that changes the action, so there will be less chances of caching, and still it's cached.\n\nThe same thing works on Chrome and IE8.
