Under Firefox 3.6 (3.6.12) (on Windows), the about:config workaround does *not* work - Firefox ignores any changes I make to the page_size_* settings, and in fact changes them back whenever I print to that printer.\n\n6. Under Firefox 5 (5.0) (on Windows), the print_paper_* settings no longer exist in about:config.\n- I have tried using the \"native\" print setup window, and the values are always ignored.\n\nI have a generated HTML page (timesheet report) that fits almost exactly on 2 A4 pages, but Firefox *always* renders it using Letter size, causing the bottom of the first page to be printed at the top of the second page; the content of the second page to start half-way down the second page; and the bottom of the second page to be truncated and not printed at all.\n\n7. Google Chrome can print the same report perfectly.\n- Sadly, this is my current workaround.\n\n8. Interestingly - if I render the report in Firefox using IETab, then the pages print correctly as well.\n--When I do this, the \"Print Preview\" window is different (it comes from IE); the printer preferences dialog is the same native dialog as Firefox shows, but it shows the (correct) paper size of A4 by default, rather than Letter as it does when that same dialog is called up by Firefox.\n\nThis problem has been around, in some form, since Firefox 0.9.something, and it still exists. The indications are that there is no simple fix or patch that will correct it.\nPerhaps the solution would be to take an existing open-source printing sub-system that works, and integrate it into both Firefox and Thunderbird?\nThe printing system from OpenOffice seems to work correctly on all platforms...\n\nCheers!\nNik", "text": "1.
