And a lot of pages (30-50-100) in the background can make even 8gb/4core computer work too slow.\n\nWhat do I propose: add something like \"Freeze Page\" functionality for each individual page. It will be something like \"take page screenshot, remove all page content from memory and place screenshot instead of page\". no java, java-script, flash or anything else, even no links, pure screenshot with all information on page.\n\nHow it can be used? Simplest way is \"Freeze\"/\"Unfreeze\" button. Load page, then click \"Freeze\", when after 1 or 2 days of idle this page become needed - just to \"Unfreeze\" or Reload page.\n\nMore complicated way is something like \"Auto-freeze\". With some tunable parameters like \"not active page for last N minutes\" or \"Page on non-active tab-group\", with list of tunable exceptions for pages like mailers/social networks, etc.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\nthis is just a FR\nActual Results:  \nthis is just a FR\n\nExpected Results:  \nless resource-hungry application\n\nthis is just a FR", "id": 5321799, "attachment_id": null, "author": "eugene.turkulevich@gmail.com", "bug_id": 638802, "raw_text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b12) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b12\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b12) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b12\n\nActually, this is not a bug, bug Feature Request.\n...any Web-Browser is resource-hungry, and there is a lot of hew and powerful hardware to make browsing faster, and a lot of information in the internet to load it and to make browsing slowly.
