These days, many (or most) users do not, but instead often use mail clients (such as GMail or iPad mail client) which users can't even set to use a fixed-width font even if they want to.\n\nSecond, that part of the notifications is nearly unusable in a screen reader -- especially if the contents of an changed field are longer than the column width allotted for it, and thus those contents are wrapped within the column.

Specifically, the HTML bug is not an acceptable fix for users who prefer to get their mail in plain text.\n\nBy the way, this is not a hypothetical problem. I personally know a blind user who relies on mutt to read her bugmail.

If you want me raise a new bug for that, with a new description making that more clear, I would be glad to do that. But being told that having HTML-formatted output is a solution to the request I'm making is not cool.\n\nIf you decide that you're not going to make any changes to the table-layout stuff in the plain-text formatting (because of the problem you cited with legacy tools expecting it to be in that format in order to parse it), then fine. That's up to you all to decide, of course.\n\nBut if so, I'd still like to very politely ask that you not dispose of this bug by marking it as a duplicate of a bug that I've already tried to make clear I don't all all consider to be related to what I'm requesting. Instead, I think it would be a lot more appropriate to mark it as WONTFIX with the comment you already made being the resolution on it (that is, \"due to all the programs which parse bugzilla's current plain-text format, unfortunately this isn't something that we can change\").", "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "(In reply to comment #8)\n> (In reply to comment #7)\n> \n> > Couldn't it be implemented it as a system option for deployments that choose\n> > to use it instead anyway? \n> \n> making this a per-installation option probably isn't worth the gain; if\n> installations of bugzilla want to customise the email, they can currently do\n> so by deploying custom email templates (see 'Template Customization' in the\n> documentation).\n\nI've looked at the relevant templates already.
