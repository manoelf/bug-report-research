This is very annoying on pages that dynamically load more contents as you scroll down (Twitter, Google image search, Facebook, etc.)\n\nChromium handles this - although it changes the scroll-bar, it doesn't change the position the cursor is currently at, so the page doesn't jump when it changes size while you scroll.\n\nWe could solve this by mimicking that behaviour, or by delaying scroll-bar changes until the scroll-handle is released. I think I prefer the latter, as it avoids any odd-looking visuals (in Chromium, your cursor will no longer be over the handle in most cases after the page-size change).", "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "If you're scrolling a page via the scroll-bar and it changes size, the position will suddenly jump as soon as you move the mouse.
