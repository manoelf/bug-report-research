When I restore the window then maximise again, the content is rendered correctly.\nNOTE: This behaviour is confirmed in normal and safe mode on two separate Windows XP SP3 machines sporting ATI and Intel graphic chipsets respectively.\nScreenshots: http://www.albez.vivaciti.net/Firefox/\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Go to a website e.g. http://armdevices.net/ and drag a URL shortcut to the desktop.\n\n2. Select Firefox options...general... \"when Firefox starts: show a blank page\"\n\n3. Select toolbar options \"tabs on top\" & \"navigation toolbar\" (on) and deselect all other toolbar options (off)\n\n4. Select options...tabs... \"open new windows in a new tab instead\" and deselect all other tab options\n\n5. Ensure normal browser window size is less than full desktop, then select maximise on the title bar to make browser fill the whole desktop (see http://www.albez.vivaciti.net/Firefox/FF-error-1.jpg)\n\n6. Now select minimise to taskbar so you can see your desktop\n\n7. Double click the URL link on the desktop\n\nActual Results:  \nFirefox renders a blank screen.  The only visible object is the title bar - all content, toolbars and tabs are missing (see http://www.albez.vivaciti.net/Firefox/FF-error-2.jpg).\n\nExpected Results:  \nFirefox should display one blank tab in background and a second foreground tab with the selected URL.  All other chrome content should remain the same.\n\nAfter perfoming the above steps, if you then select the restore button on the browser title bar, the chrome and content is restored to what would normally be expected i.e. one blank tab in background and foreground tab with the selected URL (see http://www.albez.vivaciti.net/Firefox/FF-error-3.jpg)\n\nIf the browser window is then maximised, chrome and content is still displayed correctly.
