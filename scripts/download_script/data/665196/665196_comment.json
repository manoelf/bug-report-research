The UX was worked out in those bugs, in person at a work week, and after meeting with Legal to discuss privacy issues.\n\nThe design was tricky to balance, because it had goals that were difficult to reconcile:\n\n1) Out-of-process-plugins was new and also being backported to 3.6. We very much wanted to push users towards submitting crash reports to help ensure OOPP was stable and its impact was understood.\n\n2) The UI needed to be compact and minimal. Having a plugin crash can be a bit disorienting for a user, and isn't a very good time to be asking them to make decisions. \"Just fix it!\"\n\n3) Respect the user's privacy.\n\nWe actually had a early design similar to what we want now (see bug 538910 comment 14), but that started getting tricky to implement well (see bug 538910 comment 24), and so we started exploring opt-out designs as being simpler and better for #1 and #2 above. In retrospect the opt-out design hurt #3 above (leading to the changes in bug 550293 and bug 557661), and I ended up finding a way to address my my technical concern (cmt 24) for another need anyway.\n\ntl;dr: we considered this design, moved away for other reasons, but should be OK to do it now.
