The Finder, with no window, is the front app. Or, other buggy scenario, Firefox is the front app, but the window is not the front one.\nSo in the background Firefox window there is a link to address\u00a0A. I put my mouse over the link and I press Apple. The mouse remains the normal arrow and Firefox shows no link address. This is incorrect and misleading. The mouse must be the hand and Firefox must show the link address. Because clicking makes Firefox follow the link.\nI still have Apple pressed and I click. Firefox opens the link in a tab in the background. Now Firefox shows the link address at the bottom of the window, but the mouse is still the normal arrow. This is incorrect and misleading. The mouse must be the hand.\nNow I release the Apple key. I move my mouse away from the link. I move my mouse over a non-link area of the page. Firefox still shows the old link address\u00a0A at the bottom of the window. This is incorrect. Firefox must show no link address. I move my mouse over a different link, to address\u00a0B different from A, on the page. Firefox still shows the old link address\u00a0A at the bottom of the window. This is incorrect and misleading. Firefox must show no link address. Now I press Apple. Firefox still shows the old link address\u00a0A at the bottom of the window. This is even more incorrect and misleading.
