Disable Zoom in, Zoom out and Reset controls when values are reached\n\nThanks for picking this up, Rog\u00e9rio. This looks good, but there's one problem: this function is called onpopupshowing, and the command elements are used for actions that aren't related to the popup (for example, the shortcut keys). So you can't just set their state in the popupshowing handler and then leave it that way, because it will break the commands in other pages (if you don't open the menu first).\n\nSo rather than using goSetCommandEnabled to edit the command's disabled state, let's just update the menuitems themselves (using e.g. document.getElementById(\"key_fullZoomReset\") with setAttribute/removeAttribute for \"disabled\").", "tags": [], "time": "2012-01-18T22:47:38Z", "bug_id": 698873, "creation_time": "2012-01-18T22:47:38Z", "author": "gavin.sharp@gmail.com", "raw_text": "Thanks for picking this up, Rog\u00e9rio.
