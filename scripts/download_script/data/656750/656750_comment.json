As a user I'd install spell-checkers only for the language I'll use actively. Spell-checking doesn't affect my perception of a website.\nIn contrast hyphenation affects the layout of pages and thus affects the perception of a website. As a user I'm surfing on sites in other languages than those I'm actively using as well. As a webdeveloper I'd like to rely on texts being hyphenated on the client \u2013 regardless of the language I'm using.\nConclusion: In order that webdesigner can rely on hyphenation make sure that the patterns are available without any interaction by the user!\nIdea: Expose the availability of hyphenation patterns to Javascript and implement 'hyphenate-resource'. It's up to the user to make site loading faster by installing patterns locally.\n\nb) Feedbacks on Hyphenator.js revealed that missplaced break-points are very important to customers. A faulty inner-word line-break is a spelling error and thus not acceptable. Automatic hyphenation can not be perfect!\nConclusion: Give webdevelopers good opportunities to control and fix hyphenation.\nIdeas:\n- there should be a way to display all hyphenation points in word (cf \\showhyphens in TeX).\n- don't hyphenate words that are hyphenated manually (i.e. are containing soft hyphens) -> word-level corrections\n- expose an interface for exceptions -> page-level corrections\n\nc) A major problem in narrow columns are path-like strings (links, mail-adresses). There should be an oppurtunity to break those strings, too. In Hyphenator.js I'm using the zero width space as hyphen character for paths-like strings and a simple regexp to find breakpoints conforming to TeXs url-package (http://mirror.switch.ch/ftp/mirror/tex/macros/latex/contrib/url/url.pdf)\nIdea: Implement 'hyphenate-character' and 'hyphenate-resource' and optionaly include patterns for path-like strings\n\nReproducible: Always", "creator": "mnater@mac.com", "raw_text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_7; de-de) AppleWebKit/533.21.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.5 Safari/533.21.1\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:6.0a1) Gecko/20110510 Firefox/6.0a1\n\nHi\n\nJustified text and consequently hyphenation has been a common request from customers (specially in for German-speaking websites).\nThat is why I hacked Hyphenator.js (http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/) which I always considered as a crutch until lack of hyphenation in browsers is fixed.
