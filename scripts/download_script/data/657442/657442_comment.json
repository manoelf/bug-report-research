Color should be used sparingly in your applications and, if you do use it, you must also use a secondary indicator.

An icon would be good, in my opinion.\n\nThis brings me back to the old discussion regarding the padlock.\n\nI know there have been arguments that the padlock is misleading, but I strongly disagree. In my opinion, the padlock makes sense. The meaning of the padlock is \"we're using SSL, and we have successfully verified some server certificate, and that used at least domain validation.\"\n\nYes, the argument is valid, that the padlock is not sufficient for EV.
