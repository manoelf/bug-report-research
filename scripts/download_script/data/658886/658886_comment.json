It exists because we wanted to have a place to have services-specific docs/branding/etc.  It was also where the early account management tools (reset pw, delete account) lived, and we didn't want that stuff on the main site.\n\n> * Is/Will s.m.c be home to more services?

Has been blocked on figuring out new logo guidelines.\n\n> * It looks like I made it (that's not a good thing to say for a web page).\n> Why does it look different from any other mozilla.com website?\n\nMartell made it.
