Customise -> dragged Bookmarks toolbar and locate it on the same line as the Search toolbar (the problem is the same whether it is placed to the right or to the left of the Search toolbar)\n4.

Clicking on >> temporarily displays the toolbar. Also, an extra, blank line is shown below the urlbar, containing nothing. See attached screenshot.\n5. Changing the width of the window makes no difference. The Search toolbar adapts to the available width of the window, apparently cramming out the Bookmarks toolbar.\n6.
