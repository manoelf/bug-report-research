Being stuck with 3.5.63 is a pain as its so slow to load and after about 30 mins if its left open on the screen appears to close and then I cannot re-open it because it says an incidence is already open yet I cannot find it even in task bar manager so its become a real pain in the ass to use. This error is non existent in IE7 or Chrome so your browser is becoming a major irritant to me.
