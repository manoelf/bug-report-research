Apple made it easy to distinguish their built in Top Sites from Top Sites added by the user. So we can filter away the built in items.\nI think they should go to the bookmarks menu, before the other bookmarks imported from the bookmarks menu in Safari, with a separator between the groups:\n [Bookmarks]\n  [Top Site 1]\n  [Top Site 2]\n  [----------]\n  [Bookmark imported from Safari's bookmarks menu 1]\n  [Bookmark imported from Safari's bookmarks menu 2]\n\nThat is, of course, in the case of start-up-migration.

It can, of course, easily be disabled or tweaked later. Once the migrator lands, I'll provide a patch here to disable Top Sites migration in case we don't want to release this part.\n\nAlternatively, the migrator can create a Top Sites folder (under the Bookmarks Menu or under From Safari, see above).

Despite the label, Reading list items are, in a way, similar to Unsorted Bookmarks, especially because it's the default location for new bookmarks (Ctrl+D + Enter == new item to read). However, the feature is pretty new in Safari, and it's not yet clear how people use it. Also note that items don't go away from the reading list once and item is considered \"read\". Instead, Safari has two views for its Reading List: one just for new items and one for all items.\n\nUnsorted Bookmarks are probably the way to go for start-up-migration, but I'm not so sure about migration from the Places Organizer. Another question is whether or not to migrate read items.\n\nWith the initial landing of the new migrator, I'm going with migrating all reading list items as bookmarks, regardless of the migration type.

Alas, there isn't a real API for modifying or inserting entries from the outside (as that hasn't really been a requirement and I honestly didn't think of that possibility).
