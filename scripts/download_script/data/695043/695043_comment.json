There is no other way to export the PKCS12 (that I have found after extensive searching) other than the built in API call: \n<code>\nvoid \texportPKCS12File (in nsISupports aToken, in nsILocalFile aFile, in unsigned long count,[array, size_is(count)] in nsIX509Cert aCerts)</code>\nThis function call brings up a password prompt of it's own and is embedded into the .cpp code (see https://github.com/hep-gc/grid-cert-export/issues/7 for links to source code).\n\nIt would be beneficial if an API call could be added or modified to include an optional password parameter (or bring up password prompt if null?). \n\n\nActual results:\n\nCurrently my extension needs to prompt the user for the PKCS12 password 3 times, once so I can send the request to the REST server, and then two more times for the built-in password prompt. This process confuses users because other passwords for keys and such need to be requested, and results in a less useable UI.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nA password parameter would allow extension developers to prompt the user for a password in any context they desire, then pass that password to exportPKCS12File() as a parameter.", "bug_id": 695043, "text": "User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686 on x86_64; rv:7.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0\nBuild ID: 20110922153450\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nI am writing an extension that exports PKCS12 file, sends it to a REST API and returns formatted certificates and keys (over SSL).
