I think that if a mail is sent to abd@, the sender of the reply should be abd@ and not someone else unless I expressly change the sender!\nExample: I have a private address and an info@domain address. In the info@domain address there are several subfolders, related to projects.\nI make a filter that some persons writing on the private address go in one of the subfolders.\nI want to answer to those people with the original private address... so why is TB switching the user of the replies without telling me?\nIf this is the intended way, why has it changed ony recently (before it was working the other way round).\nOr better said, what would be \"the correct\" way to group into one folder and subfolders emails coming on different accounts, but still keeping the original \"To\" as the \"From\" in the replys?", "attachment_id": null}, {"author": "ceo@stewardelectronics.com", "creator": "ceo@stewardelectronics.com", "time": "2014-08-29T00:34:45Z", "creation_time": "2014-08-29T00:34:45Z", "is_private": false, "count": 18, "id": 9245245, "tags": [], "text": "Set up another account for info@domain", "bug_id": 704613, "raw_text": "Set up another account for info@domain", "attachment_id": null}, {"is_private": false, "id": 9565443, "count": 19, "creator": "dg@cowlark.com", "creation_time": "2014-11-09T21:18:31Z", "time": "2014-11-09T21:18:31Z", "author": "dg@cowlark.com", "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "This is happening to me: I have to identities, dg@cowlark.com and david.given@gmail.com.
