But it also didn't crash\nafter 5 seconds. It didn't even after more than an hour :-)\n\nI have no idea why or what 'cured' the crash for me.\n\nMartin Kho\nProposing this as an F15 Alpha blocker:\n\n\"It must be possible to run the default web browser and a terminal application\nfrom the default desktop environment. The web browser must be able to download\nfiles, load extensions, and log into FAS\"\n\nokay, it can download files, but it shouldn't crash immediately afterwards.\nHi,\n\nJust tried what I did in comment #2... but this time Firefox didn't crash, huh?\nToday's updates installed.\n\nMartin Kho\n\nfirefox-4.0-0.5b7.fc15.x86_64\nxulrunner-2.0-0.6b7.fc15.x86_64\nPackage: firefox-4.0-0.5b7.fc15\nArchitecture: x86_64\nOS Release: Fedora release 15 (Rawhide)\n\n\nHow to reproduce\n-----\n1.
