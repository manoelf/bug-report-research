In Firefox, the empty tab is still there, and serves as container for my wanted site whenever I will request my wanted site.

In Firefox, I usually have and keep a blank tab which I leave empty. Why\u00a0? To leave Firefox open. So that Firefox do not quit whenever I close another page. And for accessing some features, like\u00a0: the menus, the Quit feature, the \u201cAbout Firefox\u201d window to view the version, the History, the Options\u2026 Because, on Windows, such features are accessible only from a tab. And because, on Windows, you can not leave an app running with no window \u2014 this must be why the name Windows\u00a0!\u00a0\u2014. That is awkward, when you come from a Mac, but that is so. And even on Firefox Mac, I am pretty sure that a few features are accessible only from a tab. A few years ago, Firefox Mac had his really awkward user interface so typical of an app coming from the dark side.

I find that rather logical that they open *in addition to* the existing stuff. \u201cIf the user didn't want anymore the existing tabs, s/he would have closed them or their whole window.\u201d We are used now to multi-tasks operating systems, multi-windows applications and multi-tabs windows. When we are in Word and we open Excel, we don't expect this action to close Word. On the other hand, the user may want to open the bookmarks or History entries *in place of* the existing stuff. But this is not evident, and should not be presumed.\n\nWe definitely have two different, significant, kinds of users.\n\nKeeping the existing tab(s) intact is the behaviour I, and many others as we see in these discussions, want and expect.\n\nLet's please everyone and have two clear & consistent behaviours. Not mixing them in one confusing behaviour.\n\n1/\u00a0Open all as new tabs, keeping the existing tab(s) intact. Let's call this action \u201cOpen all as new tabs\u201d or \u201cOpen all in new tabs\u201d.\n\n2/\u00a0Open all in tabs, overwriting the existing tab(s). Let's call that action \u201cOpen all using existing tabs\u201d.\n\n> How can I open multiple tabs without keeping any existing tabs?\n\nBy first closing them or their whole window.\u00a0:-) \nOr by using action\u00a02\u00a0: \u201cOpen all using existing tabs\u201d. But not in all cases. If you have a window with 7\u00a0tabs and you use action\u00a02 for opening, in this window, 4\u00a0bookmarks or History entries, what happens\u00a0? I expect your new pages to load in the 4\u00a0first existing tabs, and I expect the 3\u00a0remaining tabs to remain intact."}, {"creator": "ragimiri@gmail.com", "text": "Nicolas, you still did not explain, why this behavior has been changed compared to versions 4, 5, 6 and 7.", "count": 6, "author": "ragimiri@gmail.com", "bug_id": 683146, "id": 5840041, "creation_time": "2011-11-10T15:44:18Z", "is_private": false, "time": "2011-11-10T15:44:18Z", "raw_text": "Nicolas, you still did not explain, why this behavior has been changed compared to versions 4, 5, 6 and 7.", "attachment_id": null, "tags": []}, {"bug_id": 683146, "id": 5840059, "author": "murph.0912@protonmail.com", "count": 7, "text": "(In reply to Lukas from comment #6)\n> Nicolas, you still did not explain, why this behavior has been changed\n> compared to versions 4, 5, 6 and 7.\n\nBug 440093 is the one that changed the behavior.", "raw_text": "(In reply to Lukas from comment #6)\n> Nicolas, you still did not explain, why this behavior has been changed\n> compared to versions 4, 5, 6 and 7.\n\nBug 440093 is the one that changed the behavior.", "time": "2011-11-10T15:50:45Z", "is_private": false, "creation_time": "2011-11-10T15:50:45Z", "creator": "murph.0912@protonmail.com", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null}, {"bug_id": 683146, "id": 5840116, "is_private": false, "creation_time": "2011-11-10T16:06:15Z", "creator": "kurt-mozilla@se.rit.edu", "author": "kurt-mozilla@se.rit.edu", "count": 8, "text": "I still don't see how keeping the current tab makes things \"consistent\".\nIf you click a bookmark, it replaces the current tab.
