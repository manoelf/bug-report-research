I expect many other users aren't either. You are more knowledgeable about Thunderbird than the average person, I expect. ;) I went through the procedure you described. The method felt like a technical solution with many steps that require knowing where all the little options are, rather than a user-friendly feature. But it is still a clever approach.\n\nIgnoring that issue, I tried to use it once I had it set up. The first issue I had was that the new tab appeared at the right of all of my other tabs, which I have many. (I already have a love/hate relationship with email tabs.) I can fix the sorting issue by closing out my email tabs, then reopening them to cause them to sort after my search tab.  The second problem I had is that when I set the \"Pinned\" Tag on a message in my Inbox, the new search folder tab doesn't update until I do something to that tab to force it to update. \n\nLooking at Task management as a comparison, the advantage of having Tasks on the right of the screen is that they are a constant reminder, always accurate and easily accessible. My suggestion is targeted at providing a solution for those people who receive email requests (tasks) and need to manage those as well, without the use of an task entry. This is a very common problem since the fundamental aim of most communication is to share something or to request something.\n\nYour method was a great suggestion and you definitely are on the right track to meet my need, but I think there are too many small issues that keep this from being a viable solution. This method still isn't quite intuitive, set up is a challenge for a novice and it requires \"updating\" maintenance to keep the tab accurate. I still think keeping with the standard pinning approach that is common to most forums is probably the best solution. Or similar to the window pane on the right for Tasks.\n\nMaybe it's a combination of both approaches. Perhaps Tags can't still be the underlying data structure to achieve the goal. Maybe the method you describe is how it can be done, but the pinned message list display is done in a Preview Pane style, as new code, similar to how I originally described. This would avoid the creation of the search folder/tab and it's refresh delays. Any time a message is Tagged the Pinned Window/Pane would get an automatic refresh. \n\nThese are just ideas- what are your thoughts?\n(and thanks for the quick reply)", "bug_id": 642467, "creator": "alan@ondrusek.com", "raw_text": "That was a good suggestion and, in fact, many of the features you mentioned I wasn't even aware of- but...
