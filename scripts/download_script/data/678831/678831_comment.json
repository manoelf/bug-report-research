I use WinXP SP2. But when I started Firefox it cannot connect to internet. I use DSL cable connection. I checked everything, line was o.k. but when I oppened settigs I saw that Firefox is configured to connect through proxy - manual configuration. I changed to connect directly, and everything was O.K. after restarting  again same problem. I tried to change this with about:config but no result. It is annoying to change this all the time manually. I have to mention that I use Avast 6.0.1125 and problem occured after I installed it. I don`t want to deinstall it becose it is best antivirus program for me.", "count": 0, "author": "goran.ivanovski.bt@gmail.com", "creator": "goran.ivanovski.bt@gmail.com", "tags": [], "raw_text": "User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:5.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0.1\nBuild ID: 20110707182747\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nAfter finding several files infected with trojans with Avast antivirus on boot time, it deleted some files , some was from windows folder, computer restarted and worked fine.
