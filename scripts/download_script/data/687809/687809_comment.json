Apparently, the page you refer to seems to use MathJax's HTML-CSS rendering so your problem would better be handled on the MathJax side or, if one can determine a precise reason of slowness in Firefox, as a dependency of bug 745687.\n\nAnyway, MathJax's rendering engine is entirely written in Javascript and that's why it is so slow compared to the native rendering of browsers, especially for pages that contain a lot of formulas. Maybe MathJax's code can still be optimized (improvements have been made in version 2.0, but the page you mention still uses version 1.1) and Javascript execution in browsers can be made faster. But this will never be as efficient as Gecko's native rendering. So your problem will really be fixed by making MathJax use Firefox's MathML by default again, which is now the main goal of the present bug entry.\n\nOther possible reasons:\n- download time of Web fonts: to fix that, you can install local version of MathJax/STIX fonts on your system.\n- LaTeX parsing: could be made faster if done before serving the page.\n\nBTW, for those following this bug, Wikipedia now has an experimental MathJax option:\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.tech.mathml/browse_frm/thread/0ec9c3ccaee4964c#", "author": "fwang@igalia.com", "creation_time": "2012-05-14T08:34:35Z", "creator": "fwang@igalia.com", "is_private": false, "id": 6304452, "raw_text": "(In reply to elim.qiu from comment #11)\n> I noticed that Firefox on snow leopard is extremely slow with MathJax\n> content.\n> \n> Please open this page\n> http://math.elinkage.net/showthread.php?tid=102&pid=670#pid670 with various\n> browsers.\n> \n> Stop and reload is helps but it's just strange why the page cannot load in\n> the first request\n\nThis bug is to track MathML issues related to MathJax.
