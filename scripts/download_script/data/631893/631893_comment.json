I have to manually highlight the entire email then manually change text to body text in order to see the text.\nIf the text type is set to preformat, anything pasted into the body of the email doesn't show and only whitespace is seen.

Why isn't there any way for the user to change the default to something else when replying or forwarding...?\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. press reply from an open email\n2. or set type to preformat and either try to type something or past some text into the body\n3.\nActual Results:  \nwhitespace.
