Only one mail is saved by Drag&Drop?\nWhat do you call by \"Still\"?\nAbsolutely same phenomenon/symptom in any Tb release? Is there any difference between Tb 17 and Tb 24?\n\nFYI.\nIIUC, patch of bug 812923 stopped generating multiple file names upon Drag of multiple mails, in ordre to avoid performance problem in Dragstart. It was done because \"Dragging multiple messages to desktop\" does not currently work then no need of \"multiple file names\". The patch was landed on Tb 24. Following is comment in the patch source.\n+  // Dragging multiple messages to desktop does not currently work.\n+  // When core fixes for multiple-drop-on-desktop support\n+  // (e.g. bug 513464, bug 270292) are landed, generating of\n+  // \"application/x-moz-file-promise\" values for i > 0 can be enabled.\n+  // But first ensure suggestUniqueFileName is efficient enough on 10000+ dragged\n+  // messages.", "text": "(In reply to Anje from comment #10)\n> Using vista and version 24.0.1\n> Still unable to drag and drop more than one email into a folder or onto desktop.\n>(snip)\n> this was under consideration 3 years ago.\n\nWhat kind of phenomenon do you call by \"unable to drag and drop\"?\nDrag is possible but Drop is impossible? Only one mail is saved by Drag&Drop?\nWhat do you call by \"Still\"?\nAbsolutely same phenomenon/symptom in any Tb release?

Years ago the behavior was, that you could drop more Messages but only one got saved.\n\nIf it would help, I could write a sample program in C#, to demonstrate a drag&drop with virtual files using CFSTR_FILEDESCRIPTOR & co. I can't do it with c++. Or suggest a good IDE for Linux, than i could try to patch the sourcefiles of TB :)\n\nGreets", "raw_text": "(In reply to WADA from comment #15)\n> \n> What kind of phenomenon do you call by \"unable to drag and drop\"?\n> Drag is possible but Drop is impossible?
