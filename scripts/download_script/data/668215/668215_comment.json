I have archiving set to folders by year and preserve folder structure. If I select the contents of A and archive them, I get the expected folder structure:\n\nLocal\\Archives\\20xx\\A\nLocal\\Archives\\20yy\\A\n\nbut it appears that messages I RECEIVED go into the correct place, whereas those I SENT go into the \"year\" folder. IMHO, \"preserve folder structure should do exactly that, whether people have subfolders of Inbox etc, a flat structure as I do, or a combination."}, {"bug_id": 668215, "id": 11057131, "tags": [], "is_private": false, "count": 34, "attachment_id": null, "time": "2016-01-08T01:52:51Z", "text": "Yea - this should work as shown in the Account Settings - <account> - Copies and Folders - Message Archives - Archive Options - Keep Existing Folder Structure of archived messages\n\nSee this jpg:\nhttp://www.ajawamnet.com/tbirdfup.jpg", "creation_time": "2016-01-08T01:52:51Z", "raw_text": "Yea - this should work as shown in the Account Settings - <account> - Copies and Folders - Message Archives - Archive Options - Keep Existing Folder Structure of archived messages\n\nSee this jpg:\nhttp://www.ajawamnet.com/tbirdfup.jpg", "author": "ajawamnet@comcast.net", "creator": "ajawamnet@comcast.net"}, {"creation_time": "2016-01-08T01:54:48Z", "raw_text": "", "text": "Created attachment 8705440\nScreenshot of archive - keep folder structure settings", "time": "2016-01-08T01:54:48Z", "attachment_id": 8705440, "is_private": false, "count": 35, "tags": [], "id": 11057134, "bug_id": 668215, "creator": "ajawamnet@comcast.net", "author": "ajawamnet@comcast.net"}, {"time": "2016-03-23T13:19:44Z", "attachment_id": null, "text": "(In reply to Malcolm McLean from comment #32)\n> I just had the scenario where two mails in the same subfolder were archived\n> to two different archive folders.
