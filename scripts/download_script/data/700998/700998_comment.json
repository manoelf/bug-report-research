Start with a fresh profile. (or a normal profile, doesn't matter it seems)\n2. Right click in the GUI and make sure the following options are selected: \"Menu Bar\", \"Navigation Toolbar\", \"Bookmark Toolbar\", \"Add-on Bar\". (Also make sure that \"Tabs on Top\" is NOT selected so that the tabs show up under the bookmark toolbar.)\n3. Go to the following website: http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/\n4. Find the \"NFL News\" section on the right hand side of the screen and left click on any of the stories listed (don't matter which one as they will be different from when I make this report and somebody else viewing it) and watch FF open a brand new window (not tab) per Yahoo's request.\n\nActual Results: Once the new window is open, look at the GUI and notice that the \"Bookmarks Toolbar\" is now missing.  It's somehow been merged/hidden by the \"Tabs\" bar.\n\nExpected Results:  The GUI would be exactly the same as in the original FF Window, meaning the \"Bookmarks Toolbar\" would be shown properly above the tabs and not be missing.\n\n==\n\nOnce the new window has been opened, there is no way to get the \"Bookmarks Toolbar\" to show back up.  Un-selecting the option for it and turning it back on just grays out the line where the tabs are shown (just like when the new window was opened).\n\nI've also been able to duplicate this with a fresh profile on my system with no addons installed, so there isn't anything wrong with my normal profile as far as I know.\n\nFinally, if I right click on any of the \"NFL News\" stories and click \"Open Link in New Window\", this bug doesn't happen.
