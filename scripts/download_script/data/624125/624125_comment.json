Open a Firefox (Thunderbird behaves the same) window,\n2. Drag it to the bigger screen and enlarge it. It should be bigger than the size of the smaller screen.\n3. Close Firefox.\n4. Open Firefox, make sure the window is created on the smaller screen (e.g. with the setting 'Create new windows on screen of mousepointer' in Compiz)\nActual Results:  \nFirefox opens the window in fullscreen mode, so the window has no window decoration.\nNB. This fullscreen mode is not exactly the same as the Firefox fullscreen mode achieved by pressing F11. The menubar and location bar still show. Pressing F11 first puts the window in FF fullscreen mode (menubar and locationbar disappear). Pressing F11 again restores the window to normal mode.\n\nExpected Results:  \nThe window is created in normal mode and resized to fit within the screen it is created on. Preferrably respecting system toolbars on that screen.\n\nTested on Ubuntu 10.04 with GNOME, Xinerama and Compiz.\n\nWhile the problem is easy to work around with Firefox, with Thunderbird there's no easy way to solve it.
