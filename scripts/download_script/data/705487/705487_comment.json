Also, auto-complete in address bar should work right away. For now, every time I ope my laptop (wake it up from sleep) if there are multiple tabs I cannot access any of them by clicking on the tab and if I wish to create a new tab the tab doesn't show up. The problem resolves after 15-25 seconds but by then the user experience is completely damaged.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZFKlv9ceg", "attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "text": "User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:8.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0.1\nBuild ID: 20111120135848\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nAfter the latest Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) update waking up my Macbook Pro from sleep and trying to start a new tab on Firefox does not work.
