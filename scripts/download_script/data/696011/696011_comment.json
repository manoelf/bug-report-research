Sometimes it finishes loading after a long while, sometimes it does not, so I kill it through the task manager. When restarted, only the main window is opened as it was, the second window I had opened was gone.\n\n\nActual results:\n\nI have no idea why the Nightly hangs in the first place. I have an Athlon 64 3200+ on 2 GHz, 3 GB of RAM and am running Win7 on 64-bit (browser is the 64 bit version). Generally, after restart, it loads the previously hung page with ease. I should mention that I have \"do not load Tabs until selected\" selected. \n\n\nExpected results:\n\nIt should have opened the second tab as well, just like it used to. It did not happen before today, today I experienced it twice already, I mean the losing of the secondary window. I don't know if the same thing happens if you have more windows opened. The hogging of CPU and loading problems I have since you introduced the plugin container, which I did not encounter in this version of the Firefox.
