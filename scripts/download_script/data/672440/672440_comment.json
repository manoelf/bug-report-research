Do a [ctrl-c]--this will copy the highlighted text to the clipboard which can then be pasted into 'notepad'.  This has always worked on 2.0.14 and 2.2. Or\n\n4b. Keeping the cursor on the highlighted text, quickly right click and select copy, then try and paste to 'notepad'.  If you're fast with the right-click-copy, it may work but not usually.
