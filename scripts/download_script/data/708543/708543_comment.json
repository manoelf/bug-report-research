You need one mouse click to get into the inaccessible state, which is then inconvenient for keyboard-affine users. It's definitely wrong design because there's not much you can reasonably do with any Thunderbird window as long as About dialog is in the way. Also on Window manager we misrepresent the window as if the About dialog would not exist. Any small dialog is app-modal, not sure why the big one shouldn't be.", "author": "bugzilla2007@duellmann24.net", "creation_time": "2020-07-03T22:47:51Z", "raw_text": "(In reply to Wayne Mery (:wsmwk) from comment #1)\n> Is this still an accessibility issue?\n\nThis bug does not create challenges for keyboard-only users, so it's not an access problem in the strict sense.
