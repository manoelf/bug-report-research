I have already opened e-mails signed by the sender for each of the future recipients. All signatures and thus all certificates where checked and are valid. The same is true for the certification tree: all certificates up to the root certificate where checked, and are valid and are marked to be able to verify e-mail signatures.\n\n\nActual results:\n\nIf I click on Security -> Security Info the status of the certificates for all recipients is \"Not found\". If I open a signed e-mail sent to me by one of the recipients of the e-mail I am about to create, the status of that certificate changes to \"Valid\".\nSo as a workaround I open one e-mail in its own window for each recipient containing the valid signature of the recipient in the background. For example, if my e-mail has to go to 5 people, I open 5 different windows in the background, each containing one e-mail from one of the recipients,  signed with their corresponding certificate. If that is done the certificate state changes to \"Valid\".\n\nSo I end up having 5 opened windows for the 5 recipients plus my window for the new e-mail and the thunderbird main window - but at least I am able to send the e-mail.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nIt should have been sufficient to read a signed e-mail just once so that Thunderbird remembers for the future which certificate should be used and that the certificate is actually valid.\nThere should be no need to open signed e-mails in the background for eacht recipient of my e-mails.\n\nI must admit though one thing: I have colleagues who can verify the problem, I can actually verify it on a second computer - but not everyone I asked who uses Thunderbird in a S/MIME environment has the same problem.", "count": 0, "id": 5671552, "bug_id": 681212, "time": "2011-08-23T09:58:30Z", "raw_text": "User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu/11.04 Chromium/13.0.782.107 Chrome/13.0.782.107 Safari/535.1\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nI created a new e-mail to several people, the default configuration is to sign and encrypt via S/MIME.
