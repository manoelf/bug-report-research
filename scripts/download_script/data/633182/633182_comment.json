You can use it to save an entire email conversation in chronological order with quotes suppressed, as a PDF file, so that you can use it later in e.g. a report.\n\nIn order to fully document the conversation you need all the attachments and you need to be able to documents which attachment was attached to which message within the conversation. \n\nFor example, an attachment named DRAFT REPORT might be sent as an attachment by person A at 10.30 on 2009 02 22. Person B might modify it and send the modified version to A at 12.15 on 2009 02 23. Then at 13.30 the same day person A might modify it and sent it to B.\n\nIt would be very useful to be able to automatically save attachments with filenames showing which message the attachment was attached to - e.g.\n\n 2009 02 22 10.30 DRAFT REPORT\n 2009 02 23 12.15 DRAFT REPORT\n 2009 02 23 13.30 DRAFT REPORT\n\n \n\nReproducible: Always", "creation_time": "2011-02-10T14:39:07Z", "text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/9.0.597.94 Safari/534.13\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101207 Thunderbird/3.1.7\n\nThe GMail Conversation View Add-on is very good.
