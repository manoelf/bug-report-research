I think the error should go away if you move it back out of \"Other Bookmarks\" into \"Mobile Bookmarks\" on your Desktop, then sync.\n\nUnfortunately, About Sync from AMO is borked on Nightly now; I had to use my local branch to analyze your export. We'll need to cut a new release with https://github.com/mhammond/aboutsync/pull/53.\n\nWe're tracking the issue on GitHub, but I'll leave this bug open in Bugzilla until we've released the new version.
