Whenever you open the Addons manager (to the Extensions List), there is no visual indicator of where the keyboard is focused, so you are kind of lost if you are only using the keyboard. At the starting point, there is no clue where you are and no keys (except Tab) do anything. If you hit Tab once you are in the Search box which is visually obvious (good). If you hit Tab once more, you are again visually lost, but you are actually in the side-tab area (Get Add-ons, Extensions, Appearance, Plugins). If you hit Tab a third time, you are in the Extensions list, but there is no indication until you hit the Down arrow (which oddly selects the second extension listed instead of the first). This is especially bothersome to me because often in trying to select an extension I will accidentally end up in the 'Get Add-ons' page which is painfully slow to load and exit from (Bug 645516 Comment 5).", "attachment_id": null, "time": "2011-09-03T06:57:45Z", "creation_time": "2011-09-03T06:57:45Z", "raw_text": "This is related to making keyboard navigation in the Addons Manager easier.
