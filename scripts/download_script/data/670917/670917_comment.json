The term \"non-native font rendering\" is somewhat meaningless here, there are a large set of parameters that affect text rendering on Windows, there isn't a single \"native\" way.  The GDI classic vs. DirectWrite rendering modes affect the contrast of the subpixel antialiasing of text but the degree to which rendering differences exist depends upon the font (e.g. Segoe UI vs. Calibri vs. Verdana or Tahoma).  There are also elements in the UI that still use *grayscale* anti-aliasing (e.g. tooltips, status overlay) and some users have reported other elements as well (see bug 659211).  This is leftover from the work on the layer system introduced in FF4.\n\nThe contrast differences between GDI and DirectWrite rendering modes particularly affects users using the 96-dpi UI setting (\"small\") as opposed to higher DPI settings.", "creation_time": "2011-07-12T19:38:25Z", "text": "(In reply to comment #1)\n\nHi Alex.
