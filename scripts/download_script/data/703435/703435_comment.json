Two obvious changes include:\n* Opening a tab folder appends new tabs instead of destructively overwriting current tabs\n* The current tab (being viewed by the user) does not get replaced.\n\nThe bad news is that FF does not seem to have a way to re-enable the old behaviors.  While I think the current default behavior was a good change, there are also people who want a way to re-enable the older style.  This has been most notably mentioned in: Bug 683146 in the comments (ignore the subject line).\n\nIn fact, I find it rather odd that Firefox would not have a way to re-enable the old behaviors.  I am proposing that we add several new config options that re-enable the old behaviors.\n\n\n1. browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace - the default in FF is now \"false\" - support for this config was removed recently, some people want it back so they can re-enable it.\n2. browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplaceCurrent - This is a new made up config.  The default in FF is now \"false\" - this config would let people replace the current tab only when opening a tab folder (This is separate from the loadFolderAndReplace config option.)\n3. browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplaceBlank - This is also a new made up config.  The default in FF is now \"false\" - Setting it to \"true\" would replace the current tab if it is blank (about:blank); see Bug 683146 for reference.\n\n4. In Bug 701950, I suggested a more fine-grained control over tabs that goes beyond these 3 config options.  I personally, think these 3 config options would solve a large majority of the complaints I've seen.
