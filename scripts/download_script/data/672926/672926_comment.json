For me the crash occurred after watching the preview teaser for an episode on Youtube in fullscreen mode and switching out of it after it was done. I think it might have smth. to do with the new player they have launched a few days ago as that is the only unusual thing compared to other days when following this routine without this problem.\nUsing alt + mousewheel to change page content size didn't fix visibility. \nThe problem might be on windows level, as the size of the menu text is controlled via the display settings for the size of icons ( readability). I only recently changed to small in there, however it doesn't solve why the text was screwed up only in firefox.\n\n\nActual results:\n\nI have added a screen shot. Basically most of the text, is it in the homepage or the menus, crashed. It didn't happen only on the active tab (at that moment youtube), I closed it and switched to other ones as well and as you can see in the screen shot no difference. \n\n\nExpected results:\n\nWell....basically nothing, as usual.
