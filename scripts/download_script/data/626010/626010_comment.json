Firefox users have a ton of tabs open, effectively using them as lightweight bookmarks; this behavior is going to become more common with Panorama.

With many tabs open, it's frustrating to lose all context upon starting a new session or try to divine which tab is the problematic one. Being able to bookmark all of the tabs in the previous session when starting a new session would allow users to quickly start a new session and get back to work while still being able to restore tabs from the previous session if they turn out to be required later on.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
