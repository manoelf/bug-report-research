I made a small PoC to demonstrate the problem.\n\nThe poc has a menu with two menu items. Both menuitems are binded to a key and a command. The first command, which is bound to the first menuitem and first key, is hooked with addEventListener to its action. The second command, bound to the second menuitem and second key, is hooked with an oncommand attribute to its action.\n\nIf you click on both menu items with the mouse you will see that their respective actions will fire. You will see different alert boxes. If you press the combination key for the first menuitem, although the item will be highlighted, the command will not fire, i.e. the listeners installed via addEventListener will not invoke. If you press the combination key for the second menuitem you will see that there is no problem, i.e. the code inside the oncommand attribute will fire.\n\nI think this is a bug worth fixing as soon as possible because it breaks basic concepts of how the DOM works.", "attachment_id": 562023, "time": "2011-09-23T12:47:57Z", "is_private": false, "creation_time": "2011-09-23T12:47:57Z", "bug_id": 688738, "id": 5733439, "text": "Created attachment 562023\ncrash-002.zip\n\nUser Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_8) AppleWebKit/535.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/16.0.889.0 Safari/535.4\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nThis issue could be related to #371900, although if that is the case I am surprised that it hasn't been fixed.\n\nAnyway, the problem is that the command event will not fire and call the respective listeners when key combinations are invoked.
