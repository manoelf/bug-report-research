Webpage or \"Print ALL\" where the webpages  have an \"Ads by Google\" and links row included, that upon \"Print Previewing\" the \"Ads by Google\" row is severely clipped (as with first row of Print Selection)\nHOWEVER all the rest of the Webpage ABOVE of BELOW are normal in Preview AND the page(s) print out correctly, EXCEPT the \"Ads By Google\" row, which is clipped.\n\nI have no idea if there is a connection between 1) and 2) but Print Selection seems to clip on all webpages whether that \"Ads by Google\" row is there or not.\n\nI get around 2) with use of Adblock Plus which seems to block
