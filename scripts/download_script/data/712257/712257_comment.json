Ever since upgrading to Thunderbird 8 I cannot read news messages on many servers. In all those cases, newsgroups are selected for offline reading. But there are some servers, where messages are shown. And even, if I simply open newsgroup in Thunderbird and click on message while online, I still have same problem.\nEssentialy it shows me blank message preview or message tab. But in the message list it shows at least subject, sender and date from message headers. But when I select message, then I get nothing. Not even a header info is shown. It's just white. \nI did try Repair Folder, but it did not help. I upgraded now to 9.0 beta, but the problem is still same.\nOne thing I noticed on error console. When selecting  newsgroup with this problem (not all of them have this problem), I get following error on console:\nError: uncaught exception: [Exception... \"Component returned failure code: 0x80004001 (NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED) [nsIMsgDBView.numMsgsInView]\"  nsresult: \"0x80004001 (NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED)\"  location: \"JS frame :: resource:///modules/dbViewWrapper.js :: DBViewWrapper__applyViewChanges :: line 1388\"  data: no]\nMessage is only shown, when I select newsgroup first time.\nAnd I did try restarting Thunderbird with AddOns  disabled", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:8.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0\nBuild ID: 20111104165243\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nI have several news servers configured in Thunderbird.
