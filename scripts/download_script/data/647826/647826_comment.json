Example:\n\nOpen http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1104/STS134VAB_cooper900.jpg in one tab. While that is loading, open http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110402.html in another tab. The image is contained within the page, and loads in lockstep.\n\nNow close the image before it finishes loading. The load will be canceled, and with it the image will disappear from the HTML page until manual reload.\n\nNote that this doesn't happen if you open the image itself two times (instead of image+page): the second image will wait until the first one is loaded (instead of loading in lockstep) and if the first one is closed the second one will resume (however it looks like the request is re-initiated, which would be suboptimal).\n\nReproducible: Always", "id": 5391190, "attachment_id": null, "text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.2a1pre) Gecko/20110403 Firefox/4.2a1pre\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.2a1pre) Gecko/20110403 Firefox/4.2a1pre\n\nThis is very easy to reproduce if the site in question is slow enough.
