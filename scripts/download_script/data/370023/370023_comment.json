The loverspy virus is a trojan that a user sends via e-mail to a targeted computer user.  The user is enticed by a greeting card, and opens it. Microsoft Internet exploder and virus...I mean outlook express, are susceptible when they are used as direct mail clients. This is typical! \n\nHowever, with the latest, and all other updates of mozilla firefox, I found by accident, that the virus, which I think is sent as a cab file, auto installs on any machine at the click of a mouse, just like an active-x virus.  On html-based webmail, such as that from a web hosting company, clicking the link to the \"attachment\" automatically downloads and opens the virus, which self-executes, and utlizes ntvdm.exe to send out e-mail. \n\nMozilla needs to ask to save the file (or whatever it is), and or, scan it. It appears to be a malformed string issue, a bug in windows, but it passes through mozilla flawlessly.
