Windows XP machine with a GPU/driver that supports Direct3D9.  Again, about:support will tell you this.\n\n 3. OS X (10.6? 10.7? both?) machine that supports OpenGL layers.\n\n 4. Linux-x11 machine that supports OpenGL layers.  Latest Ubuntu release + NVIDIA GPU and proprietary NVIDIA drivers is usually the most reliable combination, sadly.\n\nIn that order of importance.\n\n(It would be useful at some point to check a machine without GPU layers, but the benchmarks below are so slow without GPU support that it doesn't really matter.  Plus the non-GPU path is what we've been optimizing in fennec for the last year.)\n\nTo enable out-of-process content in desktop Firefox, you have to build Firefox with the option --enable-e10s-compat, and then in about:config you have to set the pref \"browser.tabs.remote\" to true and restart.  To return to in-process content, just set that pref back to false and restart again.\n\nThe first thing we'll want to QA is checking large, complicated sites for functional bugs, like gmail.  We have a fairly comprehensive set of automated unit tests, but running through the litmus tests that we have, probably in addition to the talos5 pageset, would be a great start.\n\nKNOWN BUGS:\n - pages that use plugins are highly unlikely to work properly.  That's being tracked separately.\n - pages that use <select> elements probably won't work correctly.  That's also being tracked separately.\n\nThe second thing we'll need to manually QA is benchmark performance.  When eideticker[1] is ready, we can test performance automatically, but until then they need to be run manually.  Here's a list of the benchmarks I know of that are relatively interesting\n\n o JSGameBench\n o GUIMark2 HTML5\n o Asteroids HTML5 Canvas 2D\n o Psychedelic Browsing\n o Hardware Acceleration Stress Test\n o FishIE\n o WebGL FishIE\n\ngfx guys, am I leaving out any interesting tests?\n\nEach of these tests reports some kind of composite score or fps.
