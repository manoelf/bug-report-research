It doesn't appear to be triggered by downloads, high speed games, chats, or any particular site. \n\n\nActual results:\n\nFirefox will sporadically freeze up on me and \"Not respond\" for a short span of time. Usually about 5-10 seconds and then it \"responds\" and everything works fine. It never completely crashes which I am glad of but it is annoying enough to where I have considered downloading an earlier version or just using Internet Explorer till it stops freezing.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nWell it shouldn't have frozen. The sites should have worked just fine and there shouldn't have been any issues with it \"not responding\".", "text": "User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1\nBuild ID: 20110928134238\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nNothing out of the ordinary, it occurs on every page I have visited and nothing in particular appears to have triggered it.
