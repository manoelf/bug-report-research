I believe that a) users should be able to access it more easily as some prefer to use the zoom text only option. b) Placing it in Options would be appropriate as most users will only choose to change their zoom preferences once, or, occasionally (add-ons are available to change it on the fly). c) It's ironic that the accessibility options are tucked away in the last tab of the options manger under advanced.
