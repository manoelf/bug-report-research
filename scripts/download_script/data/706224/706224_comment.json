Decided to shut it down and reboot.  Periodically I will run CCleaner to clean up no long needed files before a reboot.\n\n\nActual results:\n\nCCleaner got to a point where it started to clear Firefox Internet cache and I saw unrecognizable file names (alphanumeric characters) were being deleted.  This took over 15 minutes before CCleaner finally finished.  \n\n\nExpected results:\n\nFirefox has always been set to clear Internet cache upon shutdown.  CCleaner normally will complete in 30 seconds or less.  I then used Windows Explorer in a small controlled test and it showed the size of the cache file at 36.7MB before Firefox shutdown.  After Firefox shutdown Windows Explorer showed the size of the cache file at 29.2KB and having 4 files:  CACHE_001, CACHE_002, CACHE_003, and CACHE_MAP.  Then ran CCleaner and these 4 files were removed.  Over a much longer period it may be possible that the files that are not being cleared properly get so large that it takes forever to remove them.  Clear cache on shutdown should have completely removed these files.", "attachment_id": null, "time": "2011-11-29T20:38:05Z", "creation_time": "2011-11-29T20:38:05Z", "raw_text": "User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:8.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0\nBuild ID: 20111104165243\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nFirefox and Windows Mail had been running for over a week without being shutdown.
