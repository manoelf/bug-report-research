The concern is that when I use the back button, the panel become blank first, indicating that FF moves one \"page\" back. I need to click more times depending on the number of the panels I have before I go back to the previous page.  Please go the bottom of the main page and click the Affiliate link to test.\n\nOther browser works fine with the above.  Therefore it seems a FF specific defect.\n\nThanks!\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Scroll to the bottom of the page\n2. Click the Affiliate link\n3.
