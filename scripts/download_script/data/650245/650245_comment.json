I just discovered that in FF4 I could no longer cut and paste while using a javascript Rich Text editor in the Moodle installation at my University. This editor is used by hundreds of instructors everyday. As instructed on mozilla.org, I edited the user.js file manually to restore the lost functionality. I consider myself above average in hacking skills and it still took me more than 10 minutes, reading a full page in mozilla.org, several restarts, and (ironically) cutting and pasting from mozilla.org to user.js in my editor to get the capability.policy to work properly. I understand the need for more secure policies, but if a feature breaks common functionality like the ubiquitous Rich Text editor, there should be an *easy* way to restore it on a site by site basis. It could be done similar to the way expired certificates are dealt with, for example, or at least a through a simple site list in Options. A user less committed to Firefox than I, will just give up and use a different browser instead of working under the hood and trying to figure it out. Thanks \n\nReproducible: Always", "is_private": false, "creation_time": "2011-04-15T13:08:55Z", "text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\n\nThis is not really a bug, but a regression caused by the new CAPS policy feature.
