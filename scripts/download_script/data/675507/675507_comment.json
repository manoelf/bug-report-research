But i dont really understand, why do we need to complicate simple tab managing functions for the sake of \"beauty\"? For instance, the old system haven't required me to hold anything, it automatically detected that i had the bookmark bar under the mouse pointer. It's much more comfortable and straightforward that way.\n\nI can drag one tab to another window when i have both of the windows on screen. But when i have one of them maximized and the other one is minimized, dragging tabs to the app-bar wont trigger/restore the chosen minimized application. More precisely, the mouse pointer cant even reach the app-bar, because the new \"dragged tab picture\" is covering everything.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mUgOy.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kwLrZ.png\n\nNow, that may be related that i dont use the default windows 7 superbar, but a third party shell (SharpEnviro), however i haven't found a single application yet that was incompatible with it, included the older firefox builds, so the issue seems to be only firefox related. Now, i can still interact nicely with the app-bar if i hold CTLR and drag any a tab to it, but this function makes a copy from the selected tab and doesn't move it to the selected firefox window.\n\nFor me, it seems that the new tab dragging system breaks a number of window managing functions. I would recommend, if its possible, that it should behave the exact same way as the old tab dragging system.", "attachment_id": null, "text": "(In reply to Mihaela Velimiroviciu [QA] from comment #1)\n> Reporter, are you still experiencing the problems?
