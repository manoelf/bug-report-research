I don't know anythning about code used by Ebay to display it, but it might be a DIV & CSS. In this section, ENDED link is not shown anymore.\nI've checked it on older Firefox (3.6.x), Opera 11 and MSIE (7/8/9) and this bug is NOT present there, so it doesn't look like bug in Ebay developer's code - which might lead to some bug in parser.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open Firefox 4, Windows 7x64 version\n2. Create an account on Ebay.co.uk\n3. Add some items to your WATCH LIST\n4. Look at WATCH LIST when auction ends - there's ALL and ACTIVE link under WATCH LIST title bar, but ENDED link is missing.\n5. Open Opera, MSIE, or old Firefox 3 and reproduce steps 1-4 to see that ENDED link exists.\nActual Results:  \nENDED link under WATCH LIST title bar is missing (hidded under other DIV ?)\n\nExpected Results:  \nENDED link under WATCH LIST title bar should have been shown.\n\nDefaqult settings, Windows 7 x64, 4 GB RAM.", "tags": [], "is_private": false, "creation_time": "2011-03-31T11:17:05Z", "text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\n\nI'm sorry for reporting this \"bug\", but E-bay made to do it.\nE-bay pages (I use co.uk domain) do have WATCH LIST section.
