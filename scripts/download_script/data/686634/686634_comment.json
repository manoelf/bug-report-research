Scrolling by one page takes on the order of 400ms. Other actions have a similar delay: opening it, switching tabs; and when resizing the window it updates ~twice per second.\n\nWithout hardware acceleration there are no such delays, and it works fluidly.  My \"from the armchair\" hunch would be the rounded corners used in this table.\n\nDuring these rendering 'glitches' firefox.exe doesn't show a considerable CPU usage. E.g. when resizing the window it averages about 30% of one CPU. (Hinting at graphics-memory delays or frequent locking??)\n\nReproduced in Firefox 4 through to most recent 7-Beta.\n\nGRAPHICS (about:support):\n\nAdapter Description: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 260\nVendor ID: 10de\nDevice ID: 05e2\nAdapter RAM: 896\nAdapter Drivers: nvd3dumx,nvwgf2umx,nvwgf2umx nvd3dum,nvwgf2um,nvwgf2umDriver \nVersion: 8.17.12.7533\nDriver Date: 5-20-2011\nDirect2D Enabled: true\nDirectWrite Enabled: true (6.1.7601.17563)\nGPU Accelerated Windows: 2/2 Direct3D 10", "bug_id": 686634, "tags": [], "time": "2011-09-14T08:03:35Z", "creation_time": "2011-09-14T08:03:35Z", "author": "ldubox-coding101@yahoo.co.uk", "count": 0, "is_private": false, "creator": "ldubox-coding101@yahoo.co.uk", "id": 5716643, "raw_text": "User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:7.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0\nBuild ID: 20110908135051\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nA particular page containing a table with lots of cells performs very poorly when hardware acceleration is enabled.
