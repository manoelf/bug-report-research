For example, I click the location bar, then select the link by using (down) arrow key and then remove link via delete key. However, when I want to do same with firefox 4.0b11, I cannot achive this. Because, it thinks that I want to switch to that tab, so it does not let me remove the link. Moreover, since I am already in the tab, switching to that tab is just meaningless, useless thing.
