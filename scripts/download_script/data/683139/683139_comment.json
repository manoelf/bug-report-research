The same way as what? As graphics? If so why? From a very simplistic point of view, the printing of text (the contents of an email in this scenario) from a terminal is pretty simple. If within the 'mozilla' design concept you (not you personally) have chosen to make it so complicated that simple text can't be printed on a white background then that is VERY unfortunate.\n\nSimple things like this, attention to small detail, are the reasons why mozilla apps (TB & FF) cannot cut it with the MS competition which is a shame as they (TB & FF) are much much better. Less attention to bells and whistles and more attention to detail is what is required (IMHO) but don't let my little rant upset you as you all are doing a great job.
