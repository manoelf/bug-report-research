(Original problem) Using Find Next with wrap-around ticked, I searched for some text \"Jefferis\" that appeared on the document before the text-cursor position. I attach a screen shot. The \"yellow X\" marks the original position of the text cursor and the two yellow circles show occurrences of the text \"Jefferis\" being searched for (but were not found).\n\n2. (Experiment) I repeated with wrap-around un-ticked and search-backwards ticked.\n\n\n\n\n\nActual results:\n\n1. Using wrap-around ticked, SeaMonkey did not find the text (nothing was highlighted and the text-cursor remained where it was, giving me the impression that the text was not in the file). Yet the text was definitely in the document (at least two occurrences). I think this is incorrect behaviour. \n\n2. Using search-backwards ticked, SeaMonkey did find the text occurrence immediately above, highlighted it and moved the text cursor to it. This appears to be correct behaviour.\n\n\n\n\nExpected results:\n\n1. I believe that Find-with-wrap-around should have searched from the current text cursor through to the end of the doocument and then searched from the top of the document to the current text cursor. If it had done so, it should have found the text string which was located a few lines above the current text cursor.\n\n2.
