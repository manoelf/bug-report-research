There are a few files we'll want to change:\n\n* `bookmarks.js`, which you already found - https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/d0448c970093f94bd986a21d3a9e8c366b316eb4/services/sync/modules/engines/bookmarks.js#128-129,142,231,326,704-705,707,721-722,724,730-731,733,735,807,812,944-945,950\n* `bookmark_repair.js` - https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/d0448c970093f94bd986a21d3a9e8c366b316eb4/services/sync/modules/bookmark_repair.js#640-641,650,670\n* `bookmark_validator.js` - https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/d0448c970093f94bd986a21d3a9e8c366b316eb4/services/sync/modules/bookmark_validator.js#295,446\n* One use in TPS - https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/d0448c970093f94bd986a21d3a9e8c366b316eb4/services/sync/tps/extensions/tps/resource/modules/bookmarks.jsm#930-931\n* Most of the functions in `PlacesSyncUtils.jsm` - https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/dca019c94bf3a840ed7ff50261483410cfece24f/toolkit/components/places/PlacesSyncUtils.jsm\n* The validators in `PlacesUtils.jsm` - https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/dca019c94bf3a840ed7ff50261483410cfece24f/toolkit/components/places/PlacesUtils.jsm#260-263.\n\nIn the `services/sync` files, let's replace `syncId` and `parentSyncId` with `recordId` and `parentRecordId`. Let's also rename the `syncID` variables to just `id`; I think that's what the other engines use. Finally, we'll need to fix up all mentions of `syncId` in the tests: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=%5BSs%5DyncId&case=true&regexp=true&path=services%2Fsync%2Ftests%2Fun You can run `./mach xpcshell-test services/sync` to make sure they still pass.\n\n`PlacesSyncUtils` is the big one. As with `bookmarks.js`, let's rename `syncId` to `recordId` everywhere, including the method names (`guidToSyncId` becomes `guidToRecordId`, `fetchChildSyncIds` becomes `fetchChildRecordIds`, and so on), and comments. The only test we'll need to update for this is https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/places/tests/unit/test_sync_utils.js.\n\nIt's a pretty mechanical replace, there are just a lot of different files in different parts of the repo. :-) Feel free to ping me if you have questions.
