So funky that I'm not sure this patch had anything to do with it.\n\nKaze, can you have a look? I tested this with switching the language of the phone in the settings app, and you'd need to have both netError.dtd and appstrings.properties localized and registered on the gecko side. For now, I did that manually. And then I hit DNS errors in the browser app. That did the right thing, but I'm not sure if I totally regressed language switching in gaia, or if that wasn't working well to begin with.",
