With more experimentation, it appears that unless the pointer is absolutely still to the pixel, the delay continues. Many pointing devices are not pixel accurate. If the pointer continues to move, the delay can be indefinite.\n\nThe expected result would be that the pop-up shows immediately as soon as the pointer crosses the bounding box of the link.", "raw_text": "(In reply to comment #2)\n> How long is the delay you see?

Surely extra logic is required to tell when the pointer stops, and that can't have been done by accident.

The general tendency that people have when something doesn't respond is to wave or move the pointer over it. In this case it has the opposite effect. Also, some people may not be able to keep the pointer still due to most common cheap pointing devices being pixel inaccurate, or due to disability.\n\n(In reply to comment #8)\n> Nevertheless, can you also try it in other browsers?

They appear immediately when the pointer enters the bounding box of the link, and generally has a more responsive feel.", "text": "(In reply to comment #7)\n> Interesting.
