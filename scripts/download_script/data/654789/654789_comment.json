Enable the security module's FIPS mode.\n2. Log out of the Software Security Device (FIPS), if necessary.\n2. Visit an untrusted secure site: e.g., use HTTPS to connect to a site with a self-signed certificate.\n3. On the \"Untrusted Connection\" page, expand the \"I understand the risks\" section.\n4. Click \"Add Exception...\"\n5. Click \"Get Certificate.\"\n6. Make sure \"Store this exception permanently\" is checked.\n7.

If, after performing the steps, I look in the list of site certificates, the certificate for the site I'm trying to trust is not there.\n\nExpected Results:  \nThe button clicks, the box closes, and the site I'm trying to trust loads. If I look in the list of site certificates, I see my newly trusted site's certificate in the list.\n\nIf, instead of step 6 above, I uncheck \"Store this exception permanently,\" the box closes and the site loads.
