Choose to 'allow' the popups from the displayed drop-down menu.\n\n[Expected result]:\n- The user shouldn't be able to allow popups from other websites than the ones mentioned in the policy.\n\n[Actual result]:\n- The policy is bypassed and popups are displayed.\n\n[Regression range]:\n- I will invesitgate further, but this does no look like a regression.\n\n[Additional notes]:\n- If the policy is deleted and the browser is restarted, it can be noticed that the website was added to the exception list.\n- The fix from bug 1568246 was intended to deny access to the exceptions part, but by using these steps, the user doesn't even need access to the exceptions list to add in websites.", "time": "2019-07-29T14:47:09Z", "author": "cristian.baica@softvision.com", "attachment_id": 9081262, "id": 14266874, "tags": [], "raw_text": "[Affected versions]:\n- Fx 70.0a1\n- Fx 69.0b9\n- Fx 68.0ESR\n\n[Affected platforms]:\n- windows 10\n- macOS 10.11\n- ubuntu 18.04\n\n[Steps to reproduce]:\n1.
