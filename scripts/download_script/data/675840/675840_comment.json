Since Firefox 4.0 major changes have been made to improve the ways webpages are composited.\n\nThese changes have been a great architectural step forward and have brought a lot of improvements. However there is some situations, particular where hardware acceleration is unavailable due to old graphics drivers, where cleartype can no longer be offered while maintaining good performance, these thought be exceptions though. There's no easy way of 'addressing this regression' within the new architecture.\n\nPossibly updating your graphics driver will get you cleartype back.", "attachment_id": null, "text": "(In reply to al_9x from comment #6)\n> Robert, please comment on this bug and Bug 677144.
