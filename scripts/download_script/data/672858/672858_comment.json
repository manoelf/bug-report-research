Even if the latter is implemented as kind of style-less private browsing mode, this isn't how we should be messaging the state to the user.  If the user set that preference to not remember history, they're only signing up for not remembering history, and the UI really needs to reflect that.", "attachment_id": null, "time": "2011-07-20T18:26:55Z", "tags": [], "text": "(In reply to comment #1)\n> (In reply to comment #0)\n> > Expected behavior: When the user disables remembering history, that\n> > preference is all that should change.
