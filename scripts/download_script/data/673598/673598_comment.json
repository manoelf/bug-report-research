On the Mac version of Firefox, open a menu of bookmarks from somewhere on the chrome (that is, via a folder on the bookmarks toolbar or via the Bookmarks button, but not via the Bookmarks menu in the menu bar).  You should pick a menu whose contents are large enough to allow for scrolling.  Submenus of menus opened from the chrome will also produce the issue, as long as they are large enough to scroll.\n2.  Scroll the menu.  This can be done via the mouse wheel, via mousing over the scroll arrows at the top and bottom of the menu, or via the arrow keys; any of these will produce the effect.\n\n\nActual results:\n\nBefore scrolling, the menu displays the proper blurred translucency effect, equivalent to that seen in native menus such as those pulled down from the menu bar.\nWhen the menu is scrolled, it appears to lose its translucency.  Close examination reveals that it is still translucent but much less so than before scrolling, to the point of being nearly indistinguishable from complete non-translucency.  The change in translucency is most noticeable over a dark background.\nThe menu remains barely-translucent after scrolling ceases.  It remains this way until ~3-4 seconds after scrolling has stopped, at which point it switches back to the normal level of translucency (until it is scrolled again).\n\nI first noticed this in FF4 under OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard on x86, and I still observe it in FF6.0 (beta channel) under OS X 10.7 Lion on x86_64.  Disabling all extensions does not alter the behavior.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nThe level of translucency seen while a menu is not scrolling should remain unchanged when it scrolls, as is seen in native OS X menus such as those pulled down from the menu bar.", "tags": [], "raw_text": "User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0\nBuild ID: 20110713171652\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1.
