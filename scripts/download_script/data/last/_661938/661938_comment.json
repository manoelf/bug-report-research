It is implemented in JavaScript, and its implementation is entirely at the level of JavaScript source. Its original design goal is to create benchmarks, and that goal will be further explored, but much interest has been expressed in using it for various other record/replay situations when in-engine instrumentation is either not an option or an undesirable option.\n\nHere's a nice first goal: Even if JSBench is only used for making benchmarks, JSBench is an astoundingly bad name. Suggestions for a new one? In keeping with animal motifs and attempting to maintain the internal shortname \"JSBNG\" (JSBench Next Generation), I suggest JaySquirrelBadgerNewtGorilla.\n\nReproducible: Always", "time": "2011-06-03T21:22:20Z", "tags": [], "author": "gkrichar@purdue.edu", "count": 0, "text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686 on x86_64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1\nBuild Identifier: \n\nPer request, this is a meta-bug to track the progress and goals of JSBench, both in terms of its original stated goal (creating benchmarks), and any new uses to be found or explored.\n\nJSBench is a system for recording and replaying JavaScript-utilizing web pages.
