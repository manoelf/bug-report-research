Caching DNS servers SHOULD recognize \"invalid\" names as special\n       and SHOULD NOT attempt to look up NS records for them, or\n       otherwise query authoritative DNS servers in an attempt to\n       resolve \"invalid\" names.  Instead, caching DNS servers SHOULD\n       generate immediate NXDOMAIN responses for all such queries.  This\n       is to avoid unnecessary load on the root name servers and other\n       name servers.\n\n   5.

DNS server operators SHOULD be aware that the effective RDATA for\n       \"invalid\" names is defined by protocol specification to be\n       nonexistent and cannot be modified by local configuration.\n\n   7.  DNS Registries/Registrars MUST NOT grant requests to register\n       \"invalid\" names in the normal way to any person or entity.  These\n       \"invalid\" names are defined by protocol specification to be\n       nonexistent, and they fall outside the set of names available for\n       allocation by registries/registrars.

Application software MAY recognize \"invalid\" names as special or\n       MAY pass them to name resolution APIs as they would for other\n       domain names.\n\n   3.  Name resolution APIs and libraries SHOULD recognize \"invalid\"\n       names as special and SHOULD always return immediate negative\n       responses.  Name resolution APIs SHOULD NOT send queries for\n       \"invalid\" names to their configured caching DNS server(s).\n\n   4.  Caching DNS servers SHOULD recognize \"invalid\" names as special\n       and SHOULD NOT attempt to look up NS records for them, or\n       otherwise query authoritative DNS servers in an attempt to\n       resolve \"invalid\" names.  Instead, caching DNS servers SHOULD\n       generate immediate NXDOMAIN responses for all such queries.  This\n       is to avoid unnecessary load on the root name servers and other\n       name servers.\n\n   5.  Authoritative DNS servers SHOULD recognize \"invalid\" names as\n       special and handle them as described above for caching DNS\n       servers.\n\n   6.  DNS server operators SHOULD be aware that the effective RDATA for\n       \"invalid\" names is defined by protocol specification to be\n       nonexistent and cannot be modified by local configuration.\n\n   7.  DNS Registries/Registrars MUST NOT grant requests to register\n       \"invalid\" names in the normal way to any person or entity.  These\n       \"invalid\" names are defined by protocol specification to be\n       nonexistent, and they fall outside the set of names available for\n       allocation by registries/registrars.  Attempting to allocate a\n       \"invalid\" name as if it were a normal DNS domain name will\n       probably not work as desired, for reasons 2, 3, 4, and 5 above.\n\nWhile this is an ugly hack, it retains all account information and is easily reversible.\n\nFor me, the ideal would be a toggle to turn the account on and off, such that if/when I deliberately choose to work offline, the offlining process does not need to query the servers of the disabled accounts when I opt to do a final download of mails before Thunderbird goes to offline processing. Note that the accounts should still appear in the drop-down menu of \"Get Messages\", and generate an informational message that the account is currently disabled if explicitly selected, and optionally give instructions on how to re-enable the account.\n\nI realise this is not a high priority issue, but given the number of 'solutions' that turn up when searching the Internet for information about this topic relating to Thunderbird, it seems to be a relatively common request.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not an itch I can scratch myself, so I can only hope a suitably qualified Thunderbird developer/maintainer has the interest and time to do this.\n\nThank-you for your time.\n\nBVF", "bug_id": 689067, "id": 13778579, "tags": [], "count": 17, "is_private": false}, {"author": "vseerror@lehigh.edu", "creator": "vseerror@lehigh.edu", "time": "2018-12-05T00:27:22Z", "attachment_id": null, "text": "*** Bug 1512022 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***", "raw_text": "", "creation_time": "2018-12-05T00:27:22Z", "bug_id": 689067, "id": 13796984, "is_private": false, "count": 18, "tags": []}, {"id": 13850727, "tags": [], "is_private": false, "count": 19, "bug_id": 689067, "raw_text": "While the \".invalid\" extension to the domain name may make the URL invalid, that does NOT make TBird *stop* trying to download from the email account.
