If days contain events that are not marked with \"show time as free\"  (which is default for allday events, and non-default for normal events), then they should already be marked bold blue. If you would like a different color, please use userChrome.css to modify the colors.\n\nIf you agree, I'd like to mark this as a duplicate of bug 614908 since the other enhancements are already working or cannot be fixed.", "creation_time": "2011-03-11T13:14:10Z", "bug_id": 640758, "id": 5338814, "time": "2011-03-11T13:14:10Z", "attachment_id": null, "creator": "philipp@bugzilla.kewis.ch", "author": "philipp@bugzilla.kewis.ch", "text": "Hey Mike, thank you for your suggestions.\n\n> 1.
