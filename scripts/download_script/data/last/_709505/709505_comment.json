I know it's similar to e.g. Google Calendar, but I think it can be improved, by doing somewhat of a combination of the weekly view and the monthly view.\n\n\nScenario 1: \n1) Open the monthly view for a calendar.\n2) Look at a day which contains e.g. only 2 appointments, say one at 8:00 AM and one at 16:00.\n3) You will see that they appear right under each other, and that all the rest of the day is left blank.\n\nWhat should have happened: the 8:00 AM appointment should be at the top of the day, and the 16:00 PM appointment should be at the end of the day, or around the middle.\n\n\nScenario 2: \n1) Open the monthly view for a calendar.\n2) Look at a day which contains only 1 appointment, say at 17:00.\n3) You will see that it appears at the top of the day, and that all the rest of the day is left blank.\n\nWhat should have happened: the appointment should be at the end of the day, or around the middle.\n\n\n\nGiven that the monthly view can't be exact regarding the hour, that shouldn't be the goal. However, dividing the space for \"one day\" in the monthly view into three regions (start, middle, end) and placing appointments into one of these brackets would be a helpful indicator. Especially on bigger screens this will be very useful.\n\nOne advantage would be that you can see at a glance whether or not you have appointments in e.g. the morning.\n\nOpen question: should the 24 hours be divided by three, or should the most commonly used 12 hours (i.e. from 8:00 AM to 20:00) be divided into the three slots, and remaining 12 hours just be added to the top & end regions?\n\nNote: if the day is already pretty full (e.g. if 2/3 of the 'day space' is used, or if one of the three regions is full), it makes sense to just ignore the regions completely, and use the current rendering.\n\nThanks for considering this.\n\nLudovic", "creation_time": "2011-12-10T21:39:40Z", "attachment_id": null, "time": "2011-12-10T21:39:40Z", "text": "It seems to me that the rendering of appointments on the monthly view isn't optimal.
