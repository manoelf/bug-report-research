Some user may want to prevent autoplay for video/audio content.\n\nThere has been quite some evangelism to explain how much html5 video is better than flash videos since html5 videos are under the control of the browser and then under the control of the user.\n\nit would be a good idea i think to allow the user to set the pref from the preference window\n\nNote that preference window [1] already has an item in Content panel to choose to load images automatically or not.
