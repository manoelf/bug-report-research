New emails could be later on added to a topic, and emails in a given topic could be further on remove from the topics (as tabs may be added and removed from groups in Panorama).\n\nAdditionally, the way Panorama displays groups of tabs could be used to display various topics in a given folder, providing an overview of the content of the folder and giving an easier access to a set of emails related with a given topic.\n\nFinally, I really thing that such a way to display emails is a real improvement in that it focuses on topics that the user defines, instead of displaying a threaded view or a conversation mode based on \"reply\" actions.\n\nI really thing that implementing this feature would place Thunderbird ahead the competition (cf.
