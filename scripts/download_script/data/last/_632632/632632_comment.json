For instance I wanted to download a file. I intitially clicked 'open item' in the open or save dialog box. Then later I changed my mind and wanted to save the file instead. Now I clicked on the file i wanted to download. This caused the downloads window to close and the open/save dialog box to open. I clicked on save file. The downloads window appeared again but this time i saw the previous download (open file) executing as well as the new download (save file) executing. I was not sure which one to stop. A differnt icon for save file versus open file in the downloads windo would make this easier to spot.\n\nReproducible: Always", "creation_time": "2011-02-09T01:30:49Z", "text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.16) Gecko/20101130 Firefox/3.5.16 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/3.0.7 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.16) Gecko/20101130 Firefox/3.5.16 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)\n\nA different icon should be shown for items being saved versus items being opened in download window.
