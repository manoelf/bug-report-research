Thus, I click on the app icon several times not knowing if I double clicked on it properly, or if it even started with the first double click, then I have several instances of the app up a minute later.\n\nWhat I suggest would be a splash window or something similar displayed right after start-up showing the user that the app has indeed started and is currently initializing. If one examines the M$ Outlook 2010 splash window, it even tells you what exactly it's initializing in a static text box IE: (Plug-In *PlugInName* 1 of 15 or such).\n\nI do not recall if Firefox under my Ubuntu 10.10 does the same thing but it probably does. \n\nThanks again for the great browser, I changed to it from IE8 three to four months ago and it's the best thing that I did.\n\nMy system specs:\nMicrosoft WindowsXP Home SP3\nAcer AspireOne D250 2 Gig RAM\n\n\nReproducible: Always", "creation_time": "2011-04-05T13:08:19Z", "raw_text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\n\nGood morning!\n\nOne thing that has been annoying me since testing Firefox4 beta's and then using the release is that when one starts it up in windows, after double clicking on it's icon on the desktop, it launches but one does not know that it is launching until the main frame window is displayed 30 to 40 seconds later.
