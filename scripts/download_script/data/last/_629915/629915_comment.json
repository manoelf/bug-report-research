This is my first bug reported at Bugzilla@Mozilla.\n\nSince Nightly on 29 January 2011 there's a small overlay on top of content at bottom of screen, to show this information is very good but I would be better to show this information closer to the location bar, for example at top of screen on top of content. If you see status activity info closer to the location bar it's more consistent UI and easier to see because you are already looking up after seeing link preview in the location bar.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Click on an any link\n2. See \n3.\nActual Results:  \nSmall overlay on top of content at bottom of screen is shown with connecting, waiting, loading status messages.\n\nExpected Results:  \nSmall overlay on top of content at the top of screen is shown with connecting, waiting, loading status messages.
