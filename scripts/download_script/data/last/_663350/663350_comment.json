Enter the URL given into Firefox 4.x\n2. Locate the link \"Zur Konferenz\" (page is in German, use search if needed)\n3. Click the link, a secondary window appears showing a sports ticker\n4. In the black \"34. Spieltag\" section locate the row \"14.05. 15:30 Bayern M\u00fcnchen 2 : 1 VfB Stuttgart\", this is a hyperlink\n5.

In this case no further navigation (menus, tool bar, address bar) is desired or necessary.\n\nThe proposal is to implement a hidden preference (about:config) that allows for reinstating the pre-FF4 behavior, which in my opinion should also be the default, but as long as there is a way to get FF back to a functional state it will be fine to keep the less desired FF4 behavior as default.", "creation_time": "2011-06-10T11:10:14Z", "time": "2011-06-10T11:10:14Z", "attachment_id": null, "text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1\n\nNote: This is NOT a duplicate of 626365\n\nCurrently, but only since FF4, a link in a secondary window opened as tab will show the tab in the primary window and even create a primary window if none exists.
