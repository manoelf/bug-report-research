Cancel aborts the original user action (don't go offline).\n\nThat ux is desirable because we do NOT want to explicitly confirm going offline (\"Do you really wont to go offline after you have clicked offline button!?\"), which is not dangerous or anything, but we're just trying to assist by avoiding potentially negative consequences of that action (not having all messages available for offline use).\n\nFTR: Imo we cannot use [Don't download] because it might be misunderstood as a final decision for those messages, whereas the decision is really between \"Download Now\" vs. \"Download Later (after going online again)\".", "author": "bugzilla2007@duellmann24.net", "creator": "bugzilla2007@duellmann24.net", "attachment_id": null}, {"is_private": false, "attachment_id": null, "tags": [], "creator": "bugzilla2007@duellmann24.net", "bug_id": 641527, "creation_time": "2015-03-02T09:13:21Z", "raw_text": "Pavel, so you could just start from the existing patch attachment 578829, and implement the code changes requested by review of comment 11 above (change the code logic).", "id": 9972658, "time": "2015-03-02T09:13:21Z", "author": "bugzilla2007@duellmann24.net", "count": 21, "text": "Pavel, so you could just start from the existing patch attachment 578829, and implement the code changes requested by review of comment 11 above (change the code logic)."}, {"author": "cerny.pav@gmail.com", "count": 22, "text": "Magnus and Thomas, I agree there is too much \"offline\" in my suggestion.

No doubts at all that \"Cancel\" will cancel that command as it does in any other dialogue of that sort (e.g. when closing draft: Save, Don't Save, Cancel). And yes, cancel really cancels everything, so it won't save, or it won't download messages at this time, either.

User is irritated because his original action was unexpectedly interrupted, and he doesn't know nor care what the dialogue is about at this time. So that's the classic no-brainer \"Cancel!\" case of \"I don't want this! Just get me outta here without touching anything\". Imagine how hard it will be for this user to analyse/understand all of these buttons with actions he doesn't know nor care about:\n> [Download Now] [Download Later] [Stay Online]\nWtf?? I just want to CANCEL this because I've never wanted this in the first place!!!\nAgain, we're making such users waste time to figure out that [Stay Online] is the non-damaging action.

Then we'd have to think about ux-error prevention...\n\nIn my experience, I have clicked \"Offline\" *at least hundreds* of times accidentally, and maybe *once* on purpose, excluding tests to try to figure out what was happening or what that feature did.  My final solution was to move the start menu to a different corner of the screen.  Ux-error prevention may be worth considering, but that's a different discussion for a different bug.  Also, that would at best reduce but not eliminate such errors.

That's what's crystal clear.  \nAs an example, when a traveler who doesn't speak the local language, finds himself at a crossroads with labeled signs pointing in different directions, he might not be able to understand what all the labels mean.

I see this as \"if I choose wrong, I will lose my messages or at least my access to them\" and I would not really want to click on the only option (\"cancel\") that does NOT give any indication that I will have access to my messages after clicking.  \"Stay online\" indicates that I will still have access to messages, via the internet connection.  It also puts my mind at ease that I'm not going to have to figure out how to get back online after this dialogue.  As soon as I see \"going offline\" I might be thinking, \"Aah! I don't want to go offline! I don't know how to get back on! How do I get back on?  Maybe there's something near where I just clicked.  Where did I just click?  That's important to remember, so I can try to figure out how to get back online after I take care of this dialogue about downloading messages.\" If I then see \"stay online,\" that solves my problem about having to figure out how to get back online, and I know it's solved.  \n\n> And it's mostly for those accidental users that we're adding this button.\nI agree.  I think those are the users we need to make things clear for.  Even more specifically, within that set there are two groups of users: (1) the ones who just want to dismiss things very quickly without trying to understand what they're being presented with, using a standard that they've learned from lots of experience with windowed applications, and (2) the ones who want to read the dialog, understand the results of clicking on each button (especially because TB is indicating that at least some choices will result in the loss of data/access), and make an informed decision.\n\nUsers in group (1) have the X button.  You're saying they might prefer the larger click target of \"Cancel\" and that might be true.  But we need to support the users in group (2) and give them an option as well, and I think that clear buttons which indicate unambiguously what the results of clicking on them will be is most appropriate for such users.

The user only has to understand that one option.  \nI think \"cancel\" is what forces accidental users to understand \"Download now\" and \"download later\" and try to figure out what action is exclusive of either of those.  \nSince both of the other options are about downloading messages, and the question also is about downloading messages, an obvious interpretation is that clicking Cancel will cancel the action of \"download messages.\" This Cancel would seem a lot like a \"download never (unless I activate such a command explicitly in the future).\" \n\nIn this dialogue, TB is telling me that it's losing its connection to the internet and indicating it may lose access to my messages if I choose wrong here. I see this as \"if I choose wrong, I will lose my messages or at least my access to them\" and I would not really want to click on the only option (\"cancel\") that does NOT give any indication that I will have access to my messages after clicking.  \"Stay online\" indicates that I will still have access to messages, via the internet connection.  It also puts my mind at ease that I'm not going to have to figure out how to get back online after this dialogue.  As soon as I see \"going offline\" I might be thinking, \"Aah! I don't want to go offline! I don't know how to get back on! How do I get back on?  Maybe there's something near where I just clicked.  Where did I just click?  That's important to remember, so I can try to figure out how to get back online after I take care of this dialogue about downloading messages.\" If I then see \"stay online,\" that solves my problem about having to figure out how to get back online, and I know it's solved.  \n\n> And it's mostly for those accidental users that we're adding this button.\nI agree.  I think those are the users we need to make things clear for.  Even more specifically, within that set there are two groups of users: (1) the ones who just want to dismiss things very quickly without trying to understand what they're being presented with, using a standard that they've learned from lots of experience with windowed applications, and (2) the ones who want to read the dialog, understand the results of clicking on each button (especially because TB is indicating that at least some choices will result in the loss of data/access), and make an informed decision.\n\nUsers in group (1) have the X button.  You're saying they might prefer the larger click target of \"Cancel\" and that might be true.  But we need to support the users in group (2) and give them an option as well, and I think that clear buttons which indicate unambiguously what the results of clicking on them will be is most appropriate for such users.
