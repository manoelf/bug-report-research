I\n> thought this from comment 3 needed to be implemented.\n\nRight-click to negate conditions (strike-through) is existing UI which is quite intuitive albeit currently not very discoverable. We should change that, probably using tooltips.\n\nAs for the difference between strike-through and unselected, or, iow:\nWHY WOULD WE NEED A THIRD BUTTON STATE?\n\n#UNSELECTED means this filter is currently *not applied*, so any other filters set will override.\n- Note that in the default state of the tag filter bar, this means that top-level \"Tags\" filter is still active which means \"Show only messages with tags on them\". That's why initially all tagged messages are showing even though no tag filter is selected.\n- Same for proposed unselected state of \"Tagged\" iconic button: If \"tagged\" is NOT SELECTED, it's currently not applied, so \"untagged\" messages will initially show alongside all \"tagged\" messages, which is \"All messages view\". However, selecting any other tag filter will override that because it's not an explicitly selected filter, but just a bigger initial scope to filter from, so if I select \"Work\", \"untagged\" messages will go away and only messages tagged \"Work\" will show. Think about it, that's totally correct and useful behaviour for users who depend on tagging.\n\n#STRIKE-THROUGH means that the *negation* of this filter is currently applied, as in (NOT Condition).\n- For proposed strike-through state of \"Tagged\" iconic button: NOT TAGGED = UNTAGGED, so untagged messages are explicitly included in the filter, and will show up in results until user explicitly unselects or flips this condition. Again, nothing special here, behaves exactly as all other tag buttons. We only tweak the logical connection a bit because E.g. \"untagged\" AND \"someTag\" doesn't work, and \"Tagged\" and \"someTag\" should obviously only return \"someTag\".\n\n(In reply to Richard Marti (:Paenglab) from comment #8)\n> I think a \"Untagged\" or \"No tag\" pseudo tag would be easier to understand\n\nIf we agree that three-state is useful as it adds integrated \"All messages\" view and allows convenient swapping to and from that view without exiting tag filter, then \"Tagged\" as in Kent's original proposal is easier to realize as we want to avoid \"Not Untagged\" default states (double negative).\nAs a sidenote, personally, I don't perceive the notion of \"Not untagged\" as a double negative, because \"untagged\" is an easily understandable term with a fixed reference. However, when it comes to icons, \"Not Untagged\" isn't easy to visualize, whereas \"Tagged\" and \"-Tagged-\" icons work just fine.\nNote that we have moved away from the notion of pseudo-tag because it fails for \"All of\".\n\n> because the \"Has tag\" needs two right clicks to set the \"no tag\".\n> If it would go directly to exclude on the first right click then it could be\n> clearer for the user.\n\nAgreed! When \"Tagged\" icon is selected (pressed down, active filter), a single right-click must immediately flip this to \"Not Tagged\", i.e. strike-trough \"-Tagged-\" icon. That can be done!\n\n> This pseudo tag should also be the first tag to be\n> always at the same position with different amount of tags.\n\nFixed position sounds good, and per ux-natural-mapping, it should be \"first on toolbar\" position, before [Any of/All of] selector (see comment 55).\n\nTo sum up, these are the three button states as proposed in comment 62, Variant 3):\n 1) [T (*)]  \"Tagged\" filter is selected/active: Show only tagged messages. Current default.\n 0) [T    ]  \"Tagged\" filter is unselected/neutral: Show untagged messages alongside tagged messages (i.e. all messages) as long as no other explicit tag filter is set. Convenient \"All messages\" view.\n-1) [-T-(*)] \"NOT Tagged\" filter is active: Show only untagged messages (if no other tag filter set), or untagged messages alongside selected tagged messages.\n\nThe latter being highly useful to find messages that haven't been tagged yet but actually should have been tagged according to their category. So e.g. filtering for \"Un-tagged\" and \"work\" allows you to find work mails which just haven't been tagged as such yet.", "creator": "bugzilla2007@duellmann24.net", "is_private": false, "id": 11644414, "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "In favor of three-state \"Tagged\" which I adapted from Kent's original model (see comment 62), let's have a second look at Richard's review comments against the original, most of which I believe are no longer applicable:\n\n(In reply to Richard Marti (:Paenglab) from comment #6)\n> Comment on attachment 8764047\n> notagfilters.xpi\n> \n> I think, we shouldn't add this button when we have the menulist \"Any of, All\n> of\".

However, selecting any other tag filter will override that because it's not an explicitly selected filter, but just a bigger initial scope to filter from, so if I select \"Work\", \"untagged\" messages will go away and only messages tagged \"Work\" will show. Think about it, that's totally correct and useful behaviour for users who depend on tagging.\n\n#STRIKE-THROUGH means that the *negation* of this filter is currently applied, as in (NOT Condition).\n- For proposed strike-through state of \"Tagged\" iconic button: NOT TAGGED = UNTAGGED, so untagged messages are explicitly included in the filter, and will show up in results until user explicitly unselects or flips this condition. Again, nothing special here, behaves exactly as all other tag buttons. We only tweak the logical connection a bit because E.g. \"untagged\" AND \"someTag\" doesn't work, and \"Tagged\" and \"someTag\" should obviously only return \"someTag\".\n\n(In reply to Richard Marti (:Paenglab) from comment #8)\n> I think a \"Untagged\" or \"No tag\" pseudo tag would be easier to understand\n\nIf we agree that three-state is useful as it adds integrated \"All messages\" view and allows convenient swapping to and from that view without exiting tag filter, then \"Tagged\" as in Kent's original proposal is easier to realize as we want to avoid \"Not Untagged\" default states (double negative).\nAs a sidenote, personally, I don't perceive the notion of \"Not untagged\" as a double negative, because \"untagged\" is an easily understandable term with a fixed reference. However, when it comes to icons, \"Not Untagged\" isn't easy to visualize, whereas \"Tagged\" and \"-Tagged-\" icons work just fine.\nNote that we have moved away from the notion of pseudo-tag because it fails for \"All of\".\n\n> because the \"Has tag\" needs two right clicks to set the \"no tag\".\n> If it would go directly to exclude on the first right click then it could be\n> clearer for the user.\n\nAgreed! When \"Tagged\" icon is selected (pressed down, active filter), a single right-click must immediately flip this to \"Not Tagged\", i.e. strike-trough \"-Tagged-\" icon. That can be done!\n\n> This pseudo tag should also be the first tag to be\n> always at the same position with different amount of tags.\n\nFixed position sounds good, and per ux-natural-mapping, it should be \"first on toolbar\" position, before [Any of/All of] selector (see comment 55).\n\nTo sum up, these are the three button states as proposed in comment 62, Variant 3):\n 1) [T (*)]  \"Tagged\" filter is selected/active: Show only tagged messages. Current default.\n 0) [T    ]  \"Tagged\" filter is unselected/neutral: Show untagged messages alongside tagged messages (i.e. all messages) as long as no other explicit tag filter is set. Convenient \"All messages\" view.\n-1) [-T-(*)] \"NOT Tagged\" filter is active: Show only untagged messages (if no other tag filter set), or untagged messages alongside selected tagged messages.\n\nThe latter being highly useful to find messages that haven't been tagged yet but actually should have been tagged according to their category.

I don't see the difference between \"Show only tagged messages\" (what I said) and \"Show all messages that have any tag\" (what you said). Our wording differs, the result set is just the same.\nKent's addon has this:\n[Any of] \"Has tag (*)\" \"Work(*)\" --> All tagged messages. While arguably logically correct, I'm not sure if that's a feature, but maybe Kent can clarify. Feature or not, imo it's odd and doesn't make sense, that's why my proposal begs to differ by relocating the button and changing the behaviour to something which imo makes more sense and is more efficient. If I overlooked something, I'll be happy to learn. I'm deliberately wordy hoping to avoid more misunderstandings such as seen with Jorg.\n\n> > -1) [-T-(*)] \"NOT Tagged\" filter is active: Show only untagged messages (if\n> > no other tag filter set), or untagged messages alongside selected tagged\n> > messages.\n> NO. Please try Kent's add-on.\n\nPlease stop insinuating. I've obviously tried Kent's addon, but my proposal deliberately and explicitly changes some of Kent's UI and behaviour. Again, looks like you're rushing to conclusions because you don't understand my proposal.\nAlso, your description of Kent's add-on behaviour is both incorrect and incomplete. Both the odd behaviour which I correctly described AND some of the behaviour described by you are present. It all depends on the state of [Any of] vs. [All of].\n\n> You will see that *negated* \"Has tag\" and \"Work\" comes to nothing since:\n\nIn my installation with Kent's addon:\n[Any of] \"-Has-tag-(*)\" \"Work(*)\" --> \"Work\" only. Which is perfectly correct, and NOT empty.\n[All of] \"Has tag(*)\" and \"Work(*)\" --> Indeed, that's an empty set. Also nonsensical,\n\n> Show messages that have no tag *and* have tag \"Work\" clearly is an empty set.\nWho said the logical connection is ^^ AND?? In my proposal, \"Tagged\" button is explicitly *outside* the scope of [Any of/All of] Selector, and there's no explicit definition of the logical connection in the UI, so we are free to dynamically change the logical connector so as to get the best overall behaviour. Jorg, please refrain from confusing people by twisting my proposal. Kent's addon-behaviour is NOT relevant for my proposal, because my design differs. My proposal for threestate behaviour remains exactly this (I'll add explanation for implicit logical operators):\n\n(In reply to Thomas D.

We could simply allow negation on all top-level quick filter criteria buttons and that would cover the need for plain vanilla \"Untagged-only\" filter:\n>  Unread AND Starred AND KnownContact AND *--HasTags--* AND HasAttachment\n\nThe game changer is the \"Kent Scenario\" part of our new \"Untagged\" filter. You can't just put Kent in a box ;) Kent is a jack of all trades playing on *both* primary AND secondary filter bars.\n\nThis would be the UI required for allowing both Kent and plain vanilla on primary qfb (these are buttons):\n>  Unread AND Starred AND KnownContact AND (*--HasTags--* OR *HasTags*) AND HasAttachment\nIow, it would need an *Untagged* button AND a *HasTags* button on primary qfb, where *HasTags* expands to individual tags as it does now. Please note: Kent on primary qfb requires *TWO* buttons!!! This is the inherent reason why two-button proposal is superior and required.\n\nNote: Kent Scenario with *two* buttons on primary qfb is another possible UI for what we're trying to implement here, and we can try to explore that, but at first sight it's not ideal:\n- unexpected special casing of having *two* tag-related buttons (whereas some users need none of them); the reason being that HasTags (after finetuning with specific tag filters) is the only condition where condition and negated condition can coexist for the same filter.\n- unexpected special casing of having an implicit *OR* condition, whereas the default for primary qfb is AND\n\nNote: It so happens from the inner logic of tags, that the default state of active (Untagged OR HasTags) combo-condition, without other conditions, effectively returns *all messages*. Again, these are the only filter criteria which can do that in active state. Any other active filter reduces the result set.\n\nWe need to understand that the functionality which we are implementing on the secondary tags filter bar inherently belongs to and originates from the primary quick filter bar, with the following button states:\n\nPlain Vanilla Untagged: *Untagged(on)*  HasTags(off)\nKent's scenario:        *Untagged(on)* *HasTags(on)* (where HasTags is really a placeholder for any specific combination of tags)\n\nNote: to go from Untagged + HasTags to Untagged-only (on primary qfb), you'd simply switch off HasTags. Jorg and I are proposing the same technique, only transposed to the secondary tag filter bar.\n\nNow most of the proposed implementations only go half-way and move the *Untagged* button from primary to secondary filter bar, leaving behind the *HasTags* button, out of Kent's minimal pair seen above: (Untagged OR HasTags). So in a way, they pretend that the \"HasTags\" button from primary bar is still doing the same job as before (which unfortunately isn't true). For those single-button solutions to realize both \"plain vanilla\" and \"Kent\", they start to dance around with unexpected behaviour:\n\nWe are on secondary tag filter bar, which by default has \"HasTags\" on, showing messages with any tags, or some certain tags. We can't ask the user to switch off a potentially unlimited number of tag filters manually, just to get into \"Untagged-only\" mode. So those single-button implementations need to tweak the behaviour so that when you click \"Untagged\", all specific tag filters will suddenly be de-activated, to allow one-click access to plain-vanilla \"Untagged-only\". So initially it looks like Untagged excludes the presence of other tag filters. Then surprisingly, you can re-activate all those specific tag filters again and they'll stay, together with \"Untagged\", to allow for the Kent Scenario. This is the resulting UI State for Kent Scenario:\n\n*Untagged(on)* OR [Any/all of] *Work(on)* *ToDo(on)*\n\n\n*The key failure of single-button proposals*\n\nAbsurdly, and violating several UX principles as I shall explain below, all single-button solutions produce different results depending on the *sequence* in which you activate the filter buttons.\nWe're now talking about click sequences (numbered clicks):\n\n1)Untagged + 2)Work + 3)ToDo --> Untagged + Work + ToDo\n3)Untagged + 1)Work + 2)ToDo --> Untagged-only\n\nResults differ, but the UI-State you were going for is exactly the same!?\nThis is totally counter-intuitive, error-prone, and inefficient if we really understand the Kent-Scenario:\nUser wants to see important messages having Work AND ToDo. So he clicks [all of], Work, then ToDo. But oh, unfortunately, today's messages have not been tagged yet, or tagging skipped a relevant older message (\"but there was this other important messages from boss, where is it?\"). So the natural thing is to just add \"Untagged\" to expand the scope and start searching for more messages there which are inherently Work and ToDo, but accidentally not yet tagged. For our single button solutions, performing this perfectly natural click sequence will surprise you with eliminating your hand-picked tag filters first, only for you to add them again one by one. How very stupid. Curse Thunderbird. And rightly so: This type of behaviour violates several ux-principles.\n\n*How single-button implicit clear-filter behaviour violates ux-principles*\n\n* ux-consistency: All other filter buttons, even on primary qfb, are additive. It must never matter in which order they are clicked, and it doesn't. There's nothing special about Untagged which would make me accept such nonsense behaviour. For quick filter bar, imagine if you are searching for \"foo\" and you don't seem to find it in recipient, sender, and subject, then you clicked \"Body\" to expand your scope, and instead of expanding, it suddenly de-activates all of recipient, sender, and subject, forcing you to re-activate them again to get recipient, sender, subject AND body. That's nonsense of the highest order, and nobody would accept it. Why would we accept it here?\n\n* ux-error-prevention, ux-mode-error: because of general additive filter behaviour, user has no reason to expect that we'll wipe out his tag filters when Untagged is clicked. I can set 10 specific tag filters, and lose all of them by clicking \"Untagged\". That's a datalossy error which should never happen.\n\n* ux-efficiency: Forcing the user to start all over again just for adding \"Untagged\" to existing active tag filters is a time-wasting nuisance and highly inefficient.\n\n* ux-discovery: Kill-the-tag filters behaviour of single Untagged button makes it much harder to discover that Untagged+SomeTags is a valid combination. Plus we are forcing users to recall from memory that it will only work in the right sequence, but not if you start out from tags. Hard to discover, hard to remember, annyoing to use.\n\nFortunately, we don't have to go that road...\n\n*The DUAL BUTTON approach: \"Untagged\" + \"All Tagged\"*\n\nThe two-button solution advocated by Jorg and myself not only avoids all of these problems, but based on the inherent logics of what we are doing here (as explained above), goes all the way to evolve our current secondary tag selector bar into a full-fledged tag filter bar, packed with useful features for the our target group of users, namely (somewhat advanced) users of tag filtering.\n\nJ\u00f6rg and I simply transposed the full combo of {Untagged OR HasTags} from primary qfb onto the start of secondary tag filter bar, as a full and independent combo *in addition* to the existing tag selector. Even though our default state maintains the original \"Show only messages with tags on them\" logic, we are more transparent about the fact that *all* proposals actually convert the top-level button into \"Show me the tag filter bar, initially with only messages with tags on them\".\nFor the moment, try to think of the top-level button as a \"Show tag filter bar\" button. Wanna do stuff with tags, so let's go. What do I want?\n\nDual button UI (*stars* indicate that button is pressed/activated) (J\u00f6rg/Thomas):\n\n1) { Untagged  *All Tagged* } [all of]  Work  Todo\n\nPlain vanilla scenario, I want untagged only, only 2 clicks to get there:\nShow \"Untagged\" (click, to select now seeing all messages), \nHide \"All Tagged\" (click to unselect, safely assisted by dynamic tooltip, \"Hide all tagged messages\").\n(It's 2 clicks owed to the fact that in default state, all proposals mimic the original \"Show only messages with tags on them\" behaviour).\n\n2) *Untagged*  All Tagged [all of]  Work  Todo\n\nFrom the default state 1), if I want Work and Todo, I'll click just that (\"All Tagged\" button will auto-deactivate, because it's now *some* tagged, no longer *all* tagged):\n\n3) Untagged  All Tagged  [all of]  *Work*  *Todo*\n\nFrom there, for Kent scenario, I want to add Untagged messages alongside Work and Todo, so I just click \"Untagged\":\n\n4) *Untagged*  All Tagged  [all of]  *Work*  *Todo*\n\nNote how the UI exactly reflects what you are seeing! And you are free to push your buttons which make your desired set of filters in any order which is convenient for your personal way of thinking and workflows.\n\nThe only workflow which is minimally harder but still perfectly logical and doable, is to transition from a \"Some specific tag filters (Work + ToDo)\" scenario to \"Untagged-only\" scenario. Remember \"Untagged-only\" is two-click from the default state of secondary tag filter bar, so as Magnus always points out, you're free to hide and unhide your tag filter bar, then simply select \"Untagged\" and deselect \"All Tagged\" (that's a felt two-click, but really 4-click).\nWhen you have specific tag filters, and you click \"Untagged\", we can't tell if you want plain-vanilla \"Untagged-only\" or \"Kent scenario\" of Untagged PLUS your current filter set. For all the ux-reasons listed above, we have to err in favor of \"Kent\" and preserve your existing tag filters when you select \"Untagged\". So to get rid of your specific tag filters, you could first select, then deselect \"All Tagged\". That's a total of 3 clicks and still reasonable if you think about it, but perhaps not perfectly intuitive and efficient. We can be better, with this tweak:\nRight-click on inactive \"All Tagged\" button, i.e. negating \"All Tagged\", will clear all of your specific tag filters AND keep \"All Tagged\" button inactive, so \"All Tagged\" are now hidden.\nFor safe and full discovery of this trick which mimics the right-click negation behaviour of other buttons on this tag filter bar, we'll offer a tooltip on \"All Tagged\" button, like this:\n\"Click to clear tag filters and show all tagged messages,\nright-click to clear tag filters and hide all tagged messages.\"\nWith that, the maximum for getting into \"Untagged-only\", even from your most sophisticated multi-tag filters, becomes two simple clicks:\nclick \"Untagged\" to show all untagged messages\nright-click \"All Tagged\" to hide all tagged messages (auto-clear of any tag filters)\n\nThat's the only minimal drawback of dual-button proposal.\nOtherwise, it's packed with goodness that tag-filter users will LOVE:\n\n*More benefits of dual-button tag filter proposal*\n\n1) Clear-Filter functionality: single click on \"All Tagged\" will reliably clear your specific multi-tag filters (even those you don't see because they are hidden behind the end of the tag filter bar. Moreover, there's visual indication that you can trust: If \"All Tagged\" is active, you are really seeing \"All Tagged\" (for which there's no reliable indication so far, neither in current behaviour, nor in single-button proposals).\n\n2) Convenient and reliable return to \"All messages\" view without hiding your entire tag filter bar:\nWith maximally two clicks, you can temporarily look into \"All messages\" before proceeding with your next filtering session. \"Untagged\" + \"All Tagged\" = \"All messages\". So easy, so obvious, and easy to get and verify from just the dual buttons. Users of tag filtering will love this. Compare with Quick Filter Bar: There's no reason to hide the entire bar when you know you'll use it again in a minute. So you can just keep your quickfilter bar staying around, even when you're actually on \"All messages\". Which saves you that one click of unhiding the filter bar each time you need to use a filter. It's so convenient. And if you're the minimalist or clean-up type, you're still free to hide your tag filter bar with a single click whenever you feel like.\n\n3) Clear status indication, transparent and predictable behaviour: At any time, no matter what you're up to, dual button UI will reflect exactly what you're seeing. If \"Untagged\" is selected, you'll see untagged. If \"All Tagged\" is selected, you'll see \"All Tagged\". If both of them are selected, you'll see exactly that, i.e. all messages. If \"Untagged\", \"Work\", and \"ToDo\" are selected, you'll see just that again. And, for your peace of mind and maximum free flow, there'll be no surprises no matter in which order you click your filter buttons. What you click is what you get. Promised. Enjoy!\n\n4) The overall advantage is that tag filter bar, like quick filter bar, becomes a self-contained, full-fledged tag filter bar which has all of your tag filtering needs conveniently combined in one place, so for those who really need tag filtering, they can just keep it open always to access all the goodies on-the-fly.", "creation_time": "2016-10-29T12:34:54Z", "author": "bugzilla2007@duellmann24.net", "text": "(In reply to Magnus Melin from comment #102)\n> (In reply to Thomas D.

This is the resulting UI State for Kent Scenario:\n\n*Untagged(on)* OR [Any/all of] *Work(on)* *ToDo(on)*\n\n\n*The key failure of single-button proposals*\n\nAbsurdly, and violating several UX principles as I shall explain below, all single-button solutions produce different results depending on the *sequence* in which you activate the filter buttons.\nWe're now talking about click sequences (numbered clicks):\n\n1)Untagged + 2)Work + 3)ToDo --> Untagged + Work + ToDo\n3)Untagged + 1)Work + 2)ToDo --> Untagged-only\n\nResults differ, but the UI-State you were going for is exactly the same!?\nThis is totally counter-intuitive, error-prone, and inefficient if we really understand the Kent-Scenario:\nUser wants to see important messages having Work AND ToDo. So he clicks [all of], Work, then ToDo. But oh, unfortunately, today's messages have not been tagged yet, or tagging skipped a relevant older message (\"but there was this other important messages from boss, where is it?\"). So the natural thing is to just add \"Untagged\" to expand the scope and start searching for more messages there which are inherently Work and ToDo, but accidentally not yet tagged. For our single button solutions, performing this perfectly natural click sequence will surprise you with eliminating your hand-picked tag filters first, only for you to add them again one by one. How very stupid. Curse Thunderbird. And rightly so: This type of behaviour violates several ux-principles.\n\n*How single-button implicit clear-filter behaviour violates ux-principles*\n\n* ux-consistency: All other filter buttons, even on primary qfb, are additive. It must never matter in which order they are clicked, and it doesn't. There's nothing special about Untagged which would make me accept such nonsense behaviour. For quick filter bar, imagine if you are searching for \"foo\" and you don't seem to find it in recipient, sender, and subject, then you clicked \"Body\" to expand your scope, and instead of expanding, it suddenly de-activates all of recipient, sender, and subject, forcing you to re-activate them again to get recipient, sender, subject AND body. That's nonsense of the highest order, and nobody would accept it. Why would we accept it here?\n\n* ux-error-prevention, ux-mode-error: because of general additive filter behaviour, user has no reason to expect that we'll wipe out his tag filters when Untagged is clicked. I can set 10 specific tag filters, and lose all of them by clicking \"Untagged\". That's a datalossy error which should never happen.\n\n* ux-efficiency: Forcing the user to start all over again just for adding \"Untagged\" to existing active tag filters is a time-wasting nuisance and highly inefficient.\n\n* ux-discovery: Kill-the-tag filters behaviour of single Untagged button makes it much harder to discover that Untagged+SomeTags is a valid combination. Plus we are forcing users to recall from memory that it will only work in the right sequence, but not if you start out from tags. Hard to discover, hard to remember, annyoing to use.\n\nFortunately, we don't have to go that road...\n\n*The DUAL BUTTON approach: \"Untagged\" + \"All Tagged\"*\n\nThe two-button solution advocated by Jorg and myself not only avoids all of these problems, but based on the inherent logics of what we are doing here (as explained above), goes all the way to evolve our current secondary tag selector bar into a full-fledged tag filter bar, packed with useful features for the our target group of users, namely (somewhat advanced) users of tag filtering.\n\nJ\u00f6rg and I simply transposed the full combo of {Untagged OR HasTags} from primary qfb onto the start of secondary tag filter bar, as a full and independent combo *in addition* to the existing tag selector. Even though our default state maintains the original \"Show only messages with tags on them\" logic, we are more transparent about the fact that *all* proposals actually convert the top-level button into \"Show me the tag filter bar, initially with only messages with tags on them\".\nFor the moment, try to think of the top-level button as a \"Show tag filter bar\" button. Wanna do stuff with tags, so let's go. What do I want?\n\nDual button UI (*stars* indicate that button is pressed/activated) (J\u00f6rg/Thomas):\n\n1) { Untagged  *All Tagged* } [all of]  Work  Todo\n\nPlain vanilla scenario, I want untagged only, only 2 clicks to get there:\nShow \"Untagged\" (click, to select now seeing all messages), \nHide \"All Tagged\" (click to unselect, safely assisted by dynamic tooltip, \"Hide all tagged messages\").\n(It's 2 clicks owed to the fact that in default state, all proposals mimic the original \"Show only messages with tags on them\" behaviour).\n\n2) *Untagged*  All Tagged [all of]  Work  Todo\n\nFrom the default state 1), if I want Work and Todo, I'll click just that (\"All Tagged\" button will auto-deactivate, because it's now *some* tagged, no longer *all* tagged):\n\n3) Untagged  All Tagged  [all of]  *Work*  *Todo*\n\nFrom there, for Kent scenario, I want to add Untagged messages alongside Work and Todo, so I just click \"Untagged\":\n\n4) *Untagged*  All Tagged  [all of]  *Work*  *Todo*\n\nNote how the UI exactly reflects what you are seeing! And you are free to push your buttons which make your desired set of filters in any order which is convenient for your personal way of thinking and workflows.\n\nThe only workflow which is minimally harder but still perfectly logical and doable, is to transition from a \"Some specific tag filters (Work + ToDo)\" scenario to \"Untagged-only\" scenario. Remember \"Untagged-only\" is two-click from the default state of secondary tag filter bar, so as Magnus always points out, you're free to hide and unhide your tag filter bar, then simply select \"Untagged\" and deselect \"All Tagged\" (that's a felt two-click, but really 4-click).\nWhen you have specific tag filters, and you click \"Untagged\", we can't tell if you want plain-vanilla \"Untagged-only\" or \"Kent scenario\" of Untagged PLUS your current filter set. For all the ux-reasons listed above, we have to err in favor of \"Kent\" and preserve your existing tag filters when you select \"Untagged\". So to get rid of your specific tag filters, you could first select, then deselect \"All Tagged\". That's a total of 3 clicks and still reasonable if you think about it, but perhaps not perfectly intuitive and efficient. We can be better, with this tweak:\nRight-click on inactive \"All Tagged\" button, i.e. negating \"All Tagged\", will clear all of your specific tag filters AND keep \"All Tagged\" button inactive, so \"All Tagged\" are now hidden.\nFor safe and full discovery of this trick which mimics the right-click negation behaviour of other buttons on this tag filter bar, we'll offer a tooltip on \"All Tagged\" button, like this:\n\"Click to clear tag filters and show all tagged messages,\nright-click to clear tag filters and hide all tagged messages.\"\nWith that, the maximum for getting into \"Untagged-only\", even from your most sophisticated multi-tag filters, becomes two simple clicks:\nclick \"Untagged\" to show all untagged messages\nright-click \"All Tagged\" to hide all tagged messages (auto-clear of any tag filters)\n\nThat's the only minimal drawback of dual-button proposal.\nOtherwise, it's packed with goodness that tag-filter users will LOVE:\n\n*More benefits of dual-button tag filter proposal*\n\n1) Clear-Filter functionality: single click on \"All Tagged\" will reliably clear your specific multi-tag filters (even those you don't see because they are hidden behind the end of the tag filter bar. Moreover, there's visual indication that you can trust: If \"All Tagged\" is active, you are really seeing \"All Tagged\" (for which there's no reliable indication so far, neither in current behaviour, nor in single-button proposals).\n\n2) Convenient and reliable return to \"All messages\" view without hiding your entire tag filter bar:\nWith maximally two clicks, you can temporarily look into \"All messages\" before proceeding with your next filtering session. \"Untagged\" + \"All Tagged\" = \"All messages\". So easy, so obvious, and easy to get and verify from just the dual buttons. Users of tag filtering will love this. Compare with Quick Filter Bar: There's no reason to hide the entire bar when you know you'll use it again in a minute. So you can just keep your quickfilter bar staying around, even when you're actually on \"All messages\". Which saves you that one click of unhiding the filter bar each time you need to use a filter. It's so convenient. And if you're the minimalist or clean-up type, you're still free to hide your tag filter bar with a single click whenever you feel like.\n\n3) Clear status indication, transparent and predictable behaviour: At any time, no matter what you're up to, dual button UI will reflect exactly what you're seeing. If \"Untagged\" is selected, you'll see untagged. If \"All Tagged\" is selected, you'll see \"All Tagged\". If both of them are selected, you'll see exactly that, i.e. all messages. If \"Untagged\", \"Work\", and \"ToDo\" are selected, you'll see just that again. And, for your peace of mind and maximum free flow, there'll be no surprises no matter in which order you click your filter buttons. What you click is what you get. Promised. Enjoy!\n\n4) The overall advantage is that tag filter bar, like quick filter bar, becomes a self-contained, full-fledged tag filter bar which has all of your tag filtering needs conveniently combined in one place, so for those who really need tag filtering, they can just keep it open always to access all the goodies on-the-fly.", "time": "2016-10-29T12:34:54Z", "tags": [], "bug_id": 683809, "is_private": false, "creator": "bugzilla2007@duellmann24.net", "count": 107}, {"raw_text": "(In reply to Magnus Melin from comment #106)\n> First of all, I don't think you can get good data from a survey with this\n> much complexity.

I can't believe that you're saying what I understand from what you're saying... \nAre you saying that \"All-Untagged-only\" should NOT be a supported use case for the secondary tag filter bar? If so, what is this bug about? The Kent-scenario only (Untagged + Specific-Tags)? Why?\nI see a summary saying \"Quick Filter: Untagged messages\", and comment 0 requesting \"Untagged-only\". \n\nExcept myself, mostly in comment 107 and 117, nobody has ever mentioned nor proposed placing \"Untagged\" button on the primary quick filter bar. Are you proposing to place \"Untagged\" button on the primary quick filter bar? I explained that it would work and be logically correct but I also gave reasons why it's probably not ideal compared to self-contained tag filter bar.\n\nPlus I don't understand your workflow for \"All-Untagged-only\"... Are you saying that in order to get untagged-only, user can switch off (unselect) \"Tags\" button on main quick filter bar? That will offer \"All-messages\", but NOT \"All-Untagged-only\". Or maybe it's a misunderstanding because your references are not clear: \"the bar\": which one? leaving \"that\" open: what? Can you please be more specific?\nFor other usecases, I think I've explained in extenso why keeping the tag filter bar always open is a usability advantage, and you yourself admitted to keeping your quick filter bar always open, for a reason, I guess.\n\n>  - clicking tags would have to shift state of the other other buttons, which\n> is unusual and might feel odd\n\nThat's not quite true. For \"Mark 2\" proposal, the default state is this (*btn* indicating selected button):\n> Untagged *All-Tagged* [all/any of]  TagX  TagY  TagZ\nSo from that UI-State it's perfectly clear that \"All-Tagged\" are shown. And before you complain about duplication, no it's not duplicated, because all proposals offered so far in this bug (Mark1, Mark1A, Mark2) change the meaning of the top-level \"Tags\" button on quick filter bar to \"Show tag filter bar, with initial state of 'All-Tagged'\". So for the top-level tags-button I proposed simple tooltip of \"Filter messages by tags\" or \"Show messages filtered by tags\" in comment 80.

I can't believe that you're saying what I understand from what you're saying... \nAre you saying that \"All-Untagged-only\" should NOT be a supported use case for the secondary tag filter bar? If so, what is this bug about? The Kent-scenario only (Untagged + Specific-Tags)? Why?\nI see a summary saying \"Quick Filter: Untagged messages\", and comment 0 requesting \"Untagged-only\". \n\nExcept myself, mostly in comment 107 and 117, nobody has ever mentioned nor proposed placing \"Untagged\" button on the primary quick filter bar. Are you proposing to place \"Untagged\" button on the primary quick filter bar? I explained that it would work and be logically correct but I also gave reasons why it's probably not ideal compared to self-contained tag filter bar.\n\nPlus I don't understand your workflow for \"All-Untagged-only\"... Are you saying that in order to get untagged-only, user can switch off (unselect) \"Tags\" button on main quick filter bar? That will offer \"All-messages\", but NOT \"All-Untagged-only\". Or maybe it's a misunderstanding because your references are not clear: \"the bar\": which one? leaving \"that\" open: what? Can you please be more specific?\nFor other usecases, I think I've explained in extenso why keeping the tag filter bar always open is a usability advantage, and you yourself admitted to keeping your quick filter bar always open, for a reason, I guess.\n\n>  - clicking tags would have to shift state of the other other buttons, which\n> is unusual and might feel odd\n\nThat's not quite true. For \"Mark 2\" proposal, the default state is this (*btn* indicating selected button):\n> Untagged *All-Tagged* [all/any of]  TagX  TagY  TagZ\nSo from that UI-State it's perfectly clear that \"All-Tagged\" are shown.
