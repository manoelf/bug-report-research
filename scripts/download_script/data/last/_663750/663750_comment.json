I'd like to make the print preview window be a XUL document containing a XUL element for each page, with a hidden print presentation for the print-previewed document, and the XUL page elements hooked up to each render one page of that presentation. The print-preview layout presentation would go away completely, simplifying layout a bit. That would let us add features to make print preview more interactive, such as selecting pages to print.
