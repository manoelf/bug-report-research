Most often those hours are not used for making appointments. Displaying those hours often detracts from the usability of Calendar (both Lightning and Sunbird). Quite a few users would benefit from ability to hide those off-hours from the view completely rather than visually distinguishing them (by shading) from the day hours. \n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Choose day or multiday view \n2. Set Day Starts to 8AM, Day Ends to 10PM, and \"Show X hours per view\" to 8. This is a real life work day hours of a medical wellness center with multiple therapists. Setting \"Show X hours per view\" to 8 allows higher resolution grid for easier bookings of appointments at 00, 15, 30, 45 minutes of the hour.\n\n\nActual Results:  \nAnnoyance #1. On start Sunbird displays midnight as first hour and one has to scroll down to see the first appointments. Lightning behaves better and displays Day Starts hour as the first hour of the view.\nAnnoyance #2. When booking or searching for appointments that fall outside the 8 hour window, scrolling (with mouse wheel) almost always goes further than Days Starts or Day Ends hours. This is most annoying when scrolling up and ending up seeing night hours from 0 to 8AM.\n\nExpected Results:  \nPlease add an option to completely hide/remove off-hours from view see mockup :\nhttp://www.starojitski.nl/calendar/hide_off_hour_option.png\n\nI believe for most people that would eliminate scroll bar completely while giving a very clean interface. Especially hiding hours when you sleep and NEVER make any appointments makes it better.\nhttp://www.starojitski.nl/calendar/nine_to_five.png\n\nBesides visual purity, this allows user to expect certain hours to be at specific locations when scrolled completely up or down. \nLess thinking time trying to find the right hour\nLess need for precision when scrolling.\nMultiply this times 100 per day x 350 days = much less frustration", "id": 5471208, "attachment_id": null, "text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1\nBuild Identifier: \n\nIn most cases big part of the day are off-hours that fall outside of Day Starts and Day Ends values.
