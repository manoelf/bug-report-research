Generally speaking I think you can take inspiration from those other projects you did, but I have a few other thoughts that may help:\n- sounds like the main branding here is Mozilla, not Firefox. That makes this trickier b/c we have fewer graphic elements to work with and a less defined visual style.\n- Kimber, are you ok with us including the Firefox logo as an element? The example in comment #0 uses it, and I think that works...the text on the card could be all about Mozilla, but the Fx logo is very powerful and makes an impact.\n- visually, I would encourage you to use those subtle background stripes we have on mozilla.com. I wouldn't use the blue color palette of the website, though, but we've used them with other colors as well...check out the example from comment #0 or http://blog.mozilla.com/userresearch/. I think the color palette from the example in comment #0 might work well for this.\n- the universal Mozilla tab (check it out on mozilla.com or the blog I just referenced) could be good here. Not essential if it doesn't fit the design, but keep it in mind. (I have files for that and the stripes if you need them.)\n\nLet me know if you want to discuss further...thanks!", "bug_id": 678050, "raw_text": "(In reply to Rhonda Spencer from comment #4)\n> Is there any graphic style you had in mind here?

Can you please place Web before Email?\n\nThanks\n\nVivien", "creator": "vjin@mozilla.com", "time": "2012-08-27T18:19:50Z", "creation_time": "2012-08-27T18:19:50Z", "author": "vjin@mozilla.com", "is_private": false, "count": 54, "id": 6586819}, {"creator": "rhonda@digital-jumpstart.com", "creation_time": "2012-08-27T20:28:10Z", "time": "2012-08-27T20:28:10Z", "author": "rhonda@digital-jumpstart.com", "is_private": false, "count": 55, "id": 6587381, "bug_id": 678050, "text": "Hey Vivien--\nHere are those changes.\n:)\n--rhonda\n\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/36432639/moz_recruiting_bus_card.pdf", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "Hey Vivien--\nHere are those changes.\n:)\n--rhonda\n\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/36432639/moz_recruiting_bus_card.pdf"}, {"tags": [], "bug_id": 678050, "text": "Hi Rhonda,\n\nBelow are more changes.\n\n1.
