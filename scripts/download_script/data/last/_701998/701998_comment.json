Many (most?) of the core apps are not downloaded from the market at all they are part of the base OS.  Every program you install (regardless of purpose) is named an app.\n\nI use and download programs on my computer - they are called applications or programs because that is what they are. My computer's OS (Ubuntu) provides all programs via an \"app store like interface\", but its just a shell over normal downloading and installing - My understanding is other OSs are doing the same - MacOS Lion and Windows 8. \n\nI'm not sure how to understand what the survey is asking questions about.  Is firefox an app?  On Windows it is the first program I download and install when starting fresh.  Does this make it an app that I run on PCs?\n\nUsing the mobile phone/tablet idea of an app suggests its not possible for me to answer yes to the 'on my PC' option short of some new emulator problems.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nBetter framing of the question and maybe a short description of what you are referring to by apps would have been helpful.\n\nI'm sorry if I seem deliberately obtuse - I honestly don't know how to answer the questions in a manner that will provide the information you are trying to collect.\n\nI hope this is an appropriate way to contact you - I found bug 699167 when googling to find any way to feed info back to the survey.
