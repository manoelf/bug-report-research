An example for this is this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9Ig19gYP9o&html5=True - of which I have attached a screenshot so that you can see what happens. The audio volume icon is invisible at first and only appears after it gets clicked, and the video never plays - I just get the \"waiting dots\".\n\nPlayback works completely fine with a new profile or with the Flash player. I can also be sure that it's not one of my addons however, since I also tried in Firefox safe mode. I also cleared the Cache folder in my Firefox profile folder, but that didn't help either.\n\nThe problems started after updating to 6.0.2.

I also want to note that I have this problem on BOTH my laptop and my desktop computer, which have completely different Firefox profiles (albeit with very similar addons). I conclude that there must be a bug in Firefox that causes this; it's too unlikely that two profiles get corrupted with the exact same bug at the same time.\n\nI am willing to investigate into this further if you tell me what I should look for.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nThe video should have displayed just fine in HTML5 with my old profile.", "creator": "natanji@gmail.com", "is_private": false, "id": 5720593, "attachment_id": 560600, "raw_text": "User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.2\nBuild ID: 20110902133214\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nTrying to play back a HTML5 video on Youtube.\n\n\nActual results:\n\nFor a few days now, I am unable to use the Youtube HTML5 video player, while the Flash player works fine.
