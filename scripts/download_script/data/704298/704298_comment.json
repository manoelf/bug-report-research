I know...   the others are all 32 bit... BUT...  what is the average user to think when they have recently moved to Linux and are trusting mozilla to suggest the correct version...???\n\nNOTE that the original report was libxul.so, and with:\n LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd` ./firefox\nit's libXrender.so.1 that's complained about here...  \n\nAs the OP in bug 685433 suggested nearly 3 months ago:\n\n> We should probably have some more user-friendly message of some sort.\nAmen!  So far, the report was about libxul; but now libXrender is it... and:\n> I doubt many users are going to add LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd` to their command line.\n\nTo that, I would add that not many users would even know to do that AFTER doing:\n cd <firefox_dir>\nor issuing [path/|./]firefox<version>/firefox\n\nSo... if someone installs a 32bit OS, no problem. Actually did that when I first setup this machine until I got my hands on 64bit version; then ff8 failed for now obvious reason...  \n\nNote that ff doesn't say where it's looking for libXrender.so.1 (short of strace)....  the ONLY version available to me (no 32bit libs) is:\n \u200e/usr/lib64/libXrender.so.1\n\nMy recommendation would be for mozilla to not only detect the basic OS; but point 64bit users to appropriate binaries...  that would avoid a lot of grief, and bad-mouthing of ff by those who get these errors without understanding the difference...\n\nI'm a ff advocate, not just a regular user -- I don't like seeing easily avoidable targets that can harm its reputation...   That said, I HATE IE...  :)\n\nPS:  are there ff{8,9,10} 64bit binaries?  I only found 64bit at ff 11 level...
