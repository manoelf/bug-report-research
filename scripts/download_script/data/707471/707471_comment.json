Just using a program to play some sound on my firewire fireface400 audio device. The music or movie playback is perfect until i launch firefox with hardware acceleration on. Discovered that the problem disappeared with gfx.direct2d.disabled true.\n\nI don't know what the problem is, so i need some help debugging it so i can provide a good bug report if it is a bug.\n\nI expect my music\\movie playback not to be affected by firefox. When i start firefox the music start to spike and my fireface400 sound-card is reporting Errors:1..5+++; Watch picture fireface400.png So in that cause it seems like firefox is causing a starvation of the sound-card buffer. But i will not guess more on what it can be.\n\nTo cause the spikes, i just have to watch a animated image like the bugzilla dragon when you search for a bug, or i can scroll a webpage up and down.\nIt also happens when i hover over the firefox gui buttons like tabs, bookmarks toolbar, etc.\n\nGraphics:\nAdapter DescriptionATI Radeon HD 4800 Series           Vendor ID1002Device ID9460Adapter RAM1024Adapter Driversaticfx64 aticfx64 aticfx64 aticfx32 aticfx32 aticfx32 atiumd64 atidxx64 atidxx64 atiumdag atidxx32 atidxx32 atiumdva atiumd6a atitmm64Driver Version8.911.0.0Driver Date10-25-2011Vendor ID (GPU #2)000eDevice ID (GPU #2)000eAdapter RAM (GPU #2)UnknownAdapter Drivers (GPU #2)UnknownDriver Version (GPU #2)7.1.542.0Driver Date (GPU #2)5-22-2006Direct2D EnabledfalseDirectWrite Enabledfalse (6.1.7601.17563)ClearType ParametersClearType parameters not foundWebGL RendererGoogle Inc. -- ANGLE (ATI Radeon HD 4800 Series           ) -- OpenGL ES 2.0 (ANGLE 0.0.0.740)GPU Accelerated Windows0/1", "creator": "ablacksheep@gmail.com", "author": "ablacksheep@gmail.com", "time": "2011-12-04T00:40:56Z", "attachment_id": 578866, "raw_text": "First of all i am using firefox beta channel (current 9.0)\n\nDescription of problem:\nBefore i start firefox, i put some music or a movie on playback.
