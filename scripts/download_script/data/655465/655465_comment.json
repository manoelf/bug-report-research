The program already has the information needed, one possible fix should be something as simple as amending a label in the download manager so that the expected filesize which is displayed during the download process is still visible when the download has completed.

I can no doubt install a later \"genuine\" Firefox, but I prefer not to go outside the repositories if I have a choice.

I can easily believe that the aborts were due to my crappy satellite connection, it's that failure of Firefox to indicate that (substantially) less data was downloaded than was expected which I think is unquestionably a bug. If no-one has worked on it, then the bug will still be there, write(*) statements don't add additional terms spontaneously. :) \n\n(*) Sorry for the Pascal terminology, me no speak 'C'.", "text": "(In reply to Wayne Mery (:wsmwk) from comment #6)\n> Reporter do you still see this problem when using recent version of\n> Thunderbird?\n\nI don't know without a little work, as I've switched to Debian since I logged this bug, and that means Iceweasel, which is based on Firefox 3.x.
