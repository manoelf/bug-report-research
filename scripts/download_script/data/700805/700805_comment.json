For example, when you install an app without having the owa extension, the Dashboard will automatically open in another tab and the app will show there. If you then install another app, the Dashboard will be automatically refreshed and the app will appear there. However, if you install apps with the extension, the Dashboard will not appear when you install an app and will not be updated if you install another app until you refresh the page.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Launch Firefox\n2. Install the Open Web Apps extension - Can be found http://people.mozilla.com/~mdabbagh/openwebapps/extension/\n3. Go to https://apps.mozillalabs.com/appdir/\n4. Install an app \n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 but without having the extension installed (will require a browser restart once you disable/remove the extension)\n\nActual Results:\nThe Dashboard is not launched when you install an app with the owa extension and it will not be automatically updated when you install another app.\n\nExpected Results:\nThe same scenario that occurs when you install apps without the owa extension should occur.
