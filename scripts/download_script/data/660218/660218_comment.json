Instead of opening the folder and displaying the contents, selecting the link for the subfolder results in the opening of a new browser page tab in Firefox, which is, of course, blank. The oddity is that does not seem to occur with main folders off the \"home page\" of a Blackboard course but only with certain, and seemingly random, subfolders contained within other folders. Those subfolders which open correctly and those that do not (and end up in a new browser tab) seem to be identical in their basic properties.\n\nI realize this is basically a Blackboard problem and not a Mozilla problem but perhaps someone there might have some insight into possible reasons for this issue. Definitely only began to occur in Firefox 4.01. Unfortunately, because of this I have to refer affected student users to IE or Chrome where the problem does not occur. Any thoughts?\n\nRandy\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
