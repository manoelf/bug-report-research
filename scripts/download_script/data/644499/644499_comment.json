Firefox 3 on Windows and Mac select the body of the alert's text when that key combination is received. This is an accessibility issue - users without a mouse can not copy text from alert messages. It seems Firefox 4 lost this functionality.\n\nAdditionally, clicking on the text and hitting Ctrl+A does not select all of the text. This might be counter-intuitive, and should be categorized as a usability issue.\n\nSide note: Windows follows a good usability pattern of allowing the user to enter Ctrl+C when an error message is displayed. The entirety of the message is saved into the clipboard. Chrome does this as well. I would recommend this feature if the previous bug is also being looked at.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Go to javascript:(function(){alert('testing!')})()\n2.
