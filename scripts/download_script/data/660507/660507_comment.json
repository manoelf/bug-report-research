Under tools|options|privacy, set cookie management to 'accept cookies from sites' but also 'keep until' as 'ask me every time'\n2. for a given site X of your choice (I use theregister.co.uk) that requires cookies and a password, but password before cookies, clear cookies and pswd for that site (so they will be asked for next time). \n3. go to X & try to log in. Password manager popup will appear asking if you'd like to remember password, a second later the cookie manager will show a 'what do you want to do with this cookie?' popup, which immediately removes the password manager popup, before you can click on it.\n\nActual Results:  \nCan't save password easily. Can get around by allowing cookie to be saved first time round then logging in 2nd time but that's not the point.\n\nExpected Results:  \nAble to save pswd and cookie in one go. \n\nSuggestion: don't change functionality that works.
