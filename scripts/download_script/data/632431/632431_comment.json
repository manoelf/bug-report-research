In the first case the contents of the target directory were damaged and Win XP checkdisk only reduced the contents of lost chains to unrecoverable files. In second case (yesterday) the target drive was damaged at the root directory. I pulled the drive from the system to attempt recovery and replaced with larger drive. This problem caused loss of all data in a 160 GB drive. Fortunately most was backed up after first anomaly. \n\nIn both cases Thunderbird reports that the \"target is write protected\" and in both cases, TB has apparently opened the file allocation table (I think was FAT) and unable to close properly. This is a serious error. If I am misguided in this being a TB error please help me resolve in the OS. However in both cases, TB was the program being used. my e-mail address is rhyolite@nettally.com and I would appreciate help. Thanks.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
