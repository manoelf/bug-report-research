Say there is a <div> element on the page that has been absolutely positioned and its display set to none.  This element's display is toggled using JS in the onmouseover/out events of an <a> element.\nWhen this <a> element is near the bottom of the viewing area, the popup will flicker when the <a> is hovered.  I found that it actually triggers the onmouseover event, then the onmouseout event, then the onmouseover again.  A friend and I determined that the status bar \"widget\" is causing it.  When the flicker occurs the status bar is on the right side of the screen, and on the left when the flicker does not occur.  The issue occurs with visibility instead of display, and the flicker also occurs using the :hover CSS psuedo class on an <a> element.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Build a normal webpage with some dummy content and an <a> tag at the bottom.\n2. Set up a :hover CSS style or onmouseover/out JS event handlers.\n3.
