As has been described, the real crux of the issue is that the reminders steal focus (and mouse/keyboard input) from the user with no warning.  This causes whatever the user was typing or possibly clicking to be ingested by the reminder window, often before the user is even aware that something has popped up.  In my opinion this issue is a foolish windows design flaw that shows up in a lot of applications, even the operating system itself.  When I say \"widows\" I may mean the Redmond OS but I also mean other window based multitask systems such as the Cupertino OS or linux or whatever.  There have been improvements over the years, with \"toast\" concepts introduced, as well as the native notifications.  In short, I understand the history of this, but it should have been fixed universally 30 years ago, which is as long as I've been dealing with this foolishness.  I can't tell you how many times I've had a \"flash\" notification from an OS or some app only to have my next keypress or mouse click accept SOMETHING on that dialog.  I don't know what it said, I don't know what I pressed, I have no idea what the ramifications are.  I just know it stole focus while I was writing something and then happened to press a space bar or enter key, or maybe it jumped up right under where I was about to click something else with my mouse, and BOOM, something was DECIDED.  It's crazy.  DESIGN FLAW.  Long overdue to be fixed.  Let's fix it in Lightning.  I use Lightning constantly and power multiple calendars with it, integrated with my work and family life, sharing with my wife on google calendars and her work's imposed MS calendar.  It works great for the most part and my family would struggle without the help of multiple shared calendars.  This issue shows up in Lightning more than anything else because I get multiple popups per hour, and the laws of statistics dictate some % of the time it's going to get interacted with before I even realize it has popped up.  I would say it happens about once every two weeks.\n\nThere are multiple related bugs and complaints that are \"different\" but all are part of making Thunderbird/Lightning notifications WORK for everyone.  The entire functionality of alerts needs to be rethought and reworked.  Here are a few others, I'm sure the list is non-exhaustive.\n\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=433531\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1164412\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1073758\n\nWhile one might say various bugs are dupes, I would instead say they are different but very related, and it would be wise to consider them in tandem.  I also would say that this bug gets closest to the heart of the biggest issue in my mind:  Stealing focus and actually DOING STUFF because the user was typing or clicking on something else but the dialog jumps up in the middle and thinks the user gave it input, even though the user did not even have a chance to see the dialog yet.\n\nIMO the way forward should include:\n* No popup or \"Alert\" should steal keyboard focus, ever.  Any window popping up and stealing focus is a DESIGN ERROR.\n  -- it SHOULD generally be VISIBLE as a top level window, but like down in the corner (an alert you never see is pointless)\n --  or at minimum for emails and appointments a system-tray icon option showing an \"alerted\" state should be visible and active such as a pulse and/or a count\n -- it should have a timer that disallows mouse interaction for a period (so a user can't accidentally click on it before knowing what they clicked) (I would suggest about 1 second, let's call this the \"DEADZONE\" period)\n -- a \"toast\" style notification should automatically disappear (fade/slide) after about 3-5 seconds.\n -- clicking a popup \"toast\" (with a mouse or touch action, AFTER the DEADZONE but before it is gone) or tray icon should then either:\n           A) launch a new interactive window (perhaps the current one is fine, since the user would have requested it by that point)\n           B) Cause the \"toast\" to be persistent and interactive, obtaining keyboard focus\n* Allow to switch between System Notification (whatever the host OS supports, if any) and app-native \"Toast\" -- some don't like the OS version, I personally agree with that on some systems\n* Allow to configure some options for how much detail and when it shows\n  -- allow to show minimal detail in any notification (due to privacy issues, when screencasting for example)\n       Just say \"You have a reminder...\" or something minimal like that\n  -- allow to respect \"focus\" settings, like \n       --don't popup at all ever (no toast, no OS notification popup), use only a system tray icon instead  (checkbox)\n       --don't popup at all when any other window is maximized (checkbox)\n       --don't popup at all when \"focus mode\" is engaged by the OS (if supported) (checkbox)\n\nAt minimum, switching to a toast style (OS native or app-native, either one or both) and supporting a \"minimal detail\" option would be a HUGE step in the right direction, other stuff could be added incrementally.\nFinally I will note, some of these ideas may be hard to implement on some OS's that's fine.  Some of these things may already exist, for example I think Thunderbird itself does handle much of this, but currently LIGHTNING does not and it needs to.\n\nI have not written code for any Mozilla project but I likely could get it done myself given enough time.  I may consider working on this type of fix, but I would want direction on if my work would be accepted.

As has been described, the real crux of the issue is that the reminders steal focus (and mouse/keyboard input) from the user with no warning.  This causes whatever the user was typing or possibly clicking to be ingested by the reminder window, often before the user is even aware that something has popped up.  In my opinion this issue is a foolish windows design flaw that shows up in a lot of applications, even the operating system itself.  When I say \"widows\" I may mean the Redmond OS but I also mean other window based multitask systems such as the Cupertino OS or linux or whatever.  There have been improvements over the years, with \"toast\" concepts introduced, as well as the native notifications.  In short, I understand the history of this, but it should have been fixed universally 30 years ago, which is as long as I've been dealing with this foolishness.  I can't tell you how many times I've had a \"flash\" notification from an OS or some app only to have my next keypress or mouse click accept SOMETHING on that dialog.  I don't know what it said, I don't know what I pressed, I have no idea what the ramifications are.  I just know it stole focus while I was writing something and then happened to press a space bar or enter key, or maybe it jumped up right under where I was about to click something else with my mouse, and BOOM, something was DECIDED.  It's crazy.  DESIGN FLAW.  Long overdue to be fixed.  Let's fix it in Lightning.  I use Lightning constantly and power multiple calendars with it, integrated with my work and family life, sharing with my wife on google calendars and her work's imposed MS calendar.  It works great for the most part and my family would struggle without the help of multiple shared calendars.  This issue shows up in Lightning more than anything else because I get multiple popups per hour, and the laws of statistics dictate some % of the time it's going to get interacted with before I even realize it has popped up.  I would say it happens about once every two weeks.\n\nThere are multiple related bugs and complaints that are \"different\" but all are part of making Thunderbird/Lightning notifications WORK for everyone.  The entire functionality of alerts needs to be rethought and reworked.  Here are a few others, I'm sure the list is non-exhaustive.\n\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=433531\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1164412\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1073758\n\nWhile one might say various bugs are dupes, I would instead say they are different but very related, and it would be wise to consider them in tandem.  I also would say that this bug gets closest to the heart of the biggest issue in my mind:  Stealing focus and actually DOING STUFF because the user was typing or clicking on something else but the dialog jumps up in the middle and thinks the user gave it input, even though the user did not even have a chance to see the dialog yet.\n\nIMO the way forward should include:\n* No popup or \"Alert\" should steal keyboard focus, ever.  Any window popping up and stealing focus is a DESIGN ERROR.\n  -- it SHOULD generally be VISIBLE as a top level window, but like down in the corner (an alert you never see is pointless)\n --  or at minimum for emails and appointments a system-tray icon option showing an \"alerted\" state should be visible and active such as a pulse and/or a count\n -- it should have a timer that disallows mouse interaction for a period (so a user can't accidentally click on it before knowing what they clicked) (I would suggest about 1 second, let's call this the \"DEADZONE\" period)\n -- a \"toast\" style notification should automatically disappear (fade/slide) after about 3-5 seconds.\n -- clicking a popup \"toast\" (with a mouse or touch action, AFTER the DEADZONE but before it is gone) or tray icon should then either:\n           A) launch a new interactive window (perhaps the current one is fine, since the user would have requested it by that point)\n           B) Cause the \"toast\" to be persistent and interactive, obtaining keyboard focus\n* Allow to switch between System Notification (whatever the host OS supports, if any) and app-native \"Toast\" -- some don't like the OS version, I personally agree with that on some systems\n* Allow to configure some options for how much detail and when it shows\n  -- allow to show minimal detail in any notification (due to privacy issues, when screencasting for example)\n       Just say \"You have a reminder...\" or something minimal like that\n  -- allow to respect \"focus\" settings, like \n       --don't popup at all ever (no toast, no OS notification popup), use only a system tray icon instead  (checkbox)\n       --don't popup at all when any other window is maximized (checkbox)\n       --don't popup at all when \"focus mode\" is engaged by the OS (if supported) (checkbox)\n\nAt minimum, switching to a toast style (OS native or app-native, either one or both) and supporting a \"minimal detail\" option would be a HUGE step in the right direction, other stuff could be added incrementally.\nFinally I will note, some of these ideas may be hard to implement on some OS's that's fine.  Some of these things may already exist, for example I think Thunderbird itself does handle much of this, but currently LIGHTNING does not and it needs to.\n\nI have not written code for any Mozilla project but I likely could get it done myself given enough time.  I may consider working on this type of fix, but I would want direction on if my work would be accepted.  Although I do have access to windows, linux, and Mac, I may lack system integration knowledge to do this well on all of them.
