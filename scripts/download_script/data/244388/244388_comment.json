If you take out the\nperiod, the columns don't shift.  If you put in longer text (replace the period\nwith the word \"dot\", for instance), the columns don't shift.  If the width of\nthe text to the left of the period is less than a specific amount, the columns\ndon't shift (even if the text to the right of the period increases by the same\namount or more).  This is very strange and hard to believe, but I will give the\nsteps I took to test this.\n\n1) The page structure:\nThis part of the page contains a table with two <td>'s.  The left <td> contains\nan <h1>, an <h2>, a <p> with some text, and a <ul> with several <li>'s.  The\nright <td> contains several <dl>'s, each with a <dt> and one or more <dd>'s. \nEach <dd> contains an anchor surrounding one or more words of text.  All of the\n<dl>'s on the right have style=\"display: none;\" set, to keep them from being\ndisplayed.  Each <li> on the left contains an anchor which invokes a JavaScript\nthat sets the style for each <dl> to display:none, and then removes that style\nfrom the appropriate dl, causing it to be displayed.  The layout of the columns\nis controlled using CSS, and all of the <dl>'s use the same class to control how\nthey are displayed.  All of this works as expected.\n\n2)The unexpected behavior:\nClicking on each of the anchors on the left causes the appropriate <dl> to\ndisplay on the right, and the layout is consistent, except for one of them -\n\"Science\".  When Science is selected, the columns shift so that the left side is\nslightly narrower, causing the content of the <p> on the left side to line-break\ndifferently.\n\n3)The cause:\nI traced the cause of the problem to the text \"Space.com\" in an <a> in the <dd>\nunder the <dl> for science on the right side.  I did numerous tests and found\nthat if I removed the period, or shortened the amount of text to the left of the\nperiod, the unexpected shift did not occur.  \n\n3) Tests:\n3a)Changing the text inside the <a>:\n\"Spacedotcom\" or \"Spaceisreallygreat\" does not produce the shift, so it is not\nthe width of the text overall that causes the shift.  \n\"Spac.com\" does not produce the shift, so reducing the amount of text to the\nleft of the period prevents the problem from occurring.\n\"Spac.com web site\" does not produce the shift, but \"Space.com web site\" does,\nso the amount of text on the right side has no effect.\n\"Spjce.com web site\" does not produce the shift, so it is not the number of\ncharacters to the left of the period that causes the shift, but rather the width\nof that text.\n\"iiiii.com\" does not produce the shift, but \"SSSSS.com\" does, confirming that it\nis the width of the text to the left of the period that causes the shift.\nReplacing \".\" with &#46; has no effect.  The behavior is the same in the above\ntests.\nRemoving the anchor prevents the shift from occurring.  \nChanging the content of the anchor does not have any effect.\nMoving the <dd> and its content into a different <dl> does not have any effect\non the behavior (they are all controlled by the same class, so I expected there\nnot to be a difference).\nI removed all <dl>'s on the right side, and the JavaScript, so that all I had on\nthe right side is one <dl> with one <dd> inside, with one <a> inside containing\nthe string \"Space.com\" and all the variations above.  Same behavior.\n\n\nReproducible: Always\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open http://www.the-noodle.com/links.htm\n2. Click Science on the list on the left side\n\n\nActual Results:  \nColumns shift to the left, causing the left column to be narrower, causing the\ncontent of the <p> to line-break differently.  Click any of the other links, and\nthe columns shift back.\n\nExpected Results:  \nThere should be no shift in the columns.\n\nI have replicated this on two PC's running Firefox 0.8, one in Windows2000 Pro,\nthe other in WindowsXP.
