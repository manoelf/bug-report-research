It steals focus by opening a new top-level window (it kept pausing my game of Atom Zombie Smasher)\n2. It blocks the entire browser UI.

It doesn't tell you anything about the redirect you're being asked to OK.\n\nThese mean that it greatly inconveniences me and that all I can do is click Cancel whenever it shows up because I have no clue what I'd be OKing otherwise.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nI see all four problems being solved by two changes:\n\n1.
