In this case the timer is in a call that is handling failure of registration (or deregistration) of the search stuff. So worse case we'd just not disable it in preferences.\n\nYou're probably also very unlikely to hit it. You've got 200ms from that failure to when the timer fires. We don't do gc that often.", "bug_id": 640912, "creator": "standard8@mozilla.com", "raw_text": "(In reply to comment #1)\n> hmm. What UI behavior might a user see as a result of a GCed timer?
