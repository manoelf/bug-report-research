It appears that Firefox is using some sort of pattern matching to determine if fields should be populated with account information.  \n\nExample:  The login page has one <input type=\"text\" . .  /> element that represents the login id, followed by a <input type=\"password\" . .  /> element that represents a password field.  Upon completing this form and selecting the Remember Me option the user visits another page, let's say an account creation page or a checkout page.  Firefox detects a password field on the page and populates the password field with the stored password.  Firefox then proceeds to populate the previous field with the login id, regardless if that field is meant to be used as a login field.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.  Create a simple HTML file that has a form that represents a login form\n2.  Complete the form with valid login information.\n3.  Select the remember me option when prompted.\n4.  Create another simple HTML file that has a form that represents a registration page.  This form should contain multiple <input type=\"text\". . /> elements with a <input type=\"password\" . . /> element thrown in somewhere on the page.\n5.  Load this page with Firefox, and view results.\nActual Results:  \nYou should now see the stored login id and password appear on the form.  You should be able to move the <input type=\"password\" . . . /> around on the form and see that Firefox populates any <input type=\"text\" . .  /> above the password text box on the form.\n\nExpected Results:  \nI would have expected Firefox to only populate a fields that match the name HTML attribute on the form fields, rather than using some sort of pattern matching to accomplish this.\n\nI have some very basic HTML files that I created to reproduce this issue.  I can send them to the team that will be correcting this issue if needed.\n\nI'm not sure if this is expected behavior or is a bug.
