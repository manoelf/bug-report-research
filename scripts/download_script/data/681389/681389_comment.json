They were empty.  This happened in Firefox 4 up till the nightly loads.  It worked fine in Firefox 3.6\n\nI had 3 other add-ons installed: Dom Inspector 2.0.10, Add-on Compatibility Reporter 0.8.7 and Console2 0.8.  If I disabled ANY of these add-ons it works again.  Also if I installed a fourth add-on it works.\n\nI finally found that if I moved the popupset overlay above the lines defining the menupopup entries being included in that popupset, it worked.\n\nI'm fairly certain this is a bug in Gecko, though where it is and what it is I don't know.\n\nBasic steps to reproduce is to create a new profile and install the following add-ons: Dom Inspector 2.0.10, Add-on Compatibility Reporter 0.8.7, Session Manager 0.7.6.1 and Console2 0.8.   Restart and open Dom Inspector and search for the id of \"sessionmanager-ContextMenu\" and notice it has no children.\n\nInstall another add-on (I picked Tab Counter 1.8.8 and check Dom Inspector again and see it has children.  Also can disable Console2 or Add-on Compatibility Reporter.\n\nIf you look at sessionmanager.xul and move the <popupset id=\"mainPopupSet\"> overlay to the top of the file, that also fixes the problem.", "raw_text": "I was working on my Session Manager add-on and noticed that the menupopup entries in my xul file that are overlayed into the window popupset (mainPopupSet) were not being overlay correctly.
