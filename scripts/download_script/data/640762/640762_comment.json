Then I open the web page with Internet Explorer 8 and saw the revised version just uploaded. no problem here! I then open Mozilla Firefox 3.6 and it still shows the old version. \n\nI check the source code from both browsers, IE8 shows the new changes whereas MF3.6 still reads the older version. The actual change was very simple: update a phone number or changing an email address.\n\nHow is this possible, given that both browsers' web address is exactly the same, i.e. pointing to the same web page on the server? I have shut down MF and restarted it without any effect.\n\nI would appreciate your opinions. \n\nMy laptop is running Windows 7 Ultimate, 64bit.
