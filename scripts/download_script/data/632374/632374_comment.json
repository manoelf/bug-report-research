Create & view multiple read-write calendars simultaneously in the normal fashion, where one is the default calendar called Home.\n2. Create an event, specifying that it is in a calendar other than Home\n3. Copy the event\n4. Select a different day and paste the event\n5.

Why? Why pasting is equaled to a new event? It is not - it's a copy of an old one. \nI understand completely why this behavior is _considered_ as logical and helpful for adding NEW events. I admit it does this work well in my case (see below).\nBut it is based on the assumption that someone switches between calendars when working with Lightning/Sunbird. But is there empirical evidence that that is the case? Any usability research? \n\nI can only speak for myself: \n- I have 4 calendars (in order of how often events are created and modified): 1. Appointments with clients, \n2. Business appointments, \n3. Clients' birthdays and \n4. Personal...\n- I have set \"Appointments with clients\" as \"default\" calendar and do not switch between those calendars at all. . That means that when i create a new appointment, in most cases i don't have to change the calendar. \n- I even got rid of left pane altogether - it just takes space and has no real use.\n\nSo far so good. But only this far!!!\n\nI use copy and paste in calendars 1, 2 en 4. And events are ALWAYS copied within a calendar and NEVER across calendars. And then, all of a sudden my personal events become \"Appointments with clients\"... It's counter intuitive and i'd say counter common sense! After all, \"calendar\" is property of an event.\nThere is another side to it. There are three other locations where people track and modify my \"Appointments with clients\" calendar... so having my personal stuff exposed there is at least unprofessional...\n\nAgain, this is my case, but i am convinced that most other people have the same (no need for cross calendar copying of events).
