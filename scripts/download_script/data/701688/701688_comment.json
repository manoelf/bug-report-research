I seems to have over expected on \"Work Offline mode\" for IMAP.\nI think this bug can be called \"current design/restriction of .msf/offline-store and panacea.dat\", because all of them are merely local cache of IMAP folder data on IMAP server or local cache of locally used file names and meta data for it.\nI don't think any consistency of any data in profile directry can be kept by profile copy. Main purpse of \"profile copy\" is to transfer definitions and local only data.\nIMAP always relies on IMAP server.\n\nThis bug's case can be relieved by improvements in panacea.dat and Work Offline mode, e.g. relative path of .msf file and offline-store file instead of absolute path in panacea.dat. However, this is similar to Bug 344671 which was already closed as WONTFIX. If profile is copied, extention is re-installed inernally, then extensions.ini is re-initialized and re-written.\n> Bug 344671 : extensions.ini should use relative paths\n\nPossible improvements for this bug's case:\nIf Tb is explicitly restarted with Work Offline mode, and if panacea.dat is deleted or .msf file pointed by panacea.dat is not found, search local directory and re-construct IMAP folders from existent xxx.msf file, and use associated/existent offline-store file named xxx, and use/search associated/existent xxx.sbd directry.\nBut I prefer impovement like next for manual server type change from IMAP to POP3;\n(a) If ...msf only(no offline-store file while IMAP), create file named xxx, access it as xxx folder, and access xxx.sbd as directory for sub folders. This is useful when user deleted xxx instead of xxx.msf by mistake and subfolders under xxx.sbd is lost.

I seems to have over expected on \"Work Offline mode\" for IMAP.\nI think this bug can be called \"current design/restriction of .msf/offline-store and panacea.dat\", because all of them are merely local cache of IMAP folder data on IMAP server or local cache of locally used file names and meta data for it.\nI don't think any consistency of any data in profile directry can be kept by profile copy. Main purpse of \"profile copy\" is to transfer definitions and local only data.\nIMAP always relies on IMAP server.\n\nThis bug's case can be relieved by improvements in panacea.dat and Work Offline mode, e.g. relative path of .msf file and offline-store file instead of absolute path in panacea.dat.
