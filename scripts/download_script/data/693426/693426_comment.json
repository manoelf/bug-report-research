There seems to be no reason not to do so. V8 earley-boyer creates a ton of call objects.\n\nWith this patch, on a version of earley-boyer that runs in 6.842s, my GC time drops from 0.297s to 0.080s (a change of 0.217s). The total time to run the benchmark drops from 6.842s to 6.670s (a change of 0.172s).\n\nIt's a little unfortunate that the drop in total time is less than the drop in GC time. It means that we don't have a good sense of how much slower things are running because of the background finalization. However, I think the patch is worth taking since it's small and a clear improvement.", "tags": [], "time": "2011-10-10T20:51:24Z", "is_private": false, "creator": "bill.mccloskey@gmail.com", "id": 5772620, "attachment_id": 566025, "raw_text": "We're not finalizing call objects on the background thread.
