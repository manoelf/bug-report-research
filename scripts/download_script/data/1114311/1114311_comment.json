This happened soon after I updated the font. None of the other browsers have this problem. I tested this in Windows 7, XP and Puppy Linux. The problem is isolated to Firefox only.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nThe web page (a blog at blogspot.com) should show the text in the hosted web font. I tested the font for errors. Also tested the .htacess file. It has the correct directive that is working properly on another web font server. (smartfonts.net)\n\nI think that FF expects the URL for the font to be a relative address because the domain of the blog and the web font appear to be the same. A complication is that the blog's real domain is blogspot.com though its alias or 'canonical' URL is from ahangama.com.\n\nI cannot change the CSS of the blog right now because Google seems to have withdrawn that facility. Besides, that could break proper display by all other browsers.\n\nMy humble suggestion is for Firefox to go by the IP address than the name of the domains when deciding if a web font is legitimately hosted.\n\nThanks.\n\nJC\nPS: The web font attached", "tags": [], "time": "2014-12-21T06:03:24Z", "text": "Created attachment 8539765\nsamagana.woff\n\nUser Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0\nBuild ID: 20141126041045\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nWent to this web site:\nThe actual URL: http://harimaga.blogspot.com/ \nIts 'convenience' URL is:\nhttp://blog.ahangama.com/\nIf you check the source code, you will see the following line in it that makes the alias URL:\n<link href='http://blog.ahangama.com/' rel='canonical'/>\n(See: http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/02/specify-your-canonical.html)\n\nAlso please notice that the font is called with this CSS rule:\n@font-face{font-family:samagana;\nsrc:url(http://ahangama.com/woff/samagana.woff) format(\"woff\");}\n\n\nActual results:\n\nFirefox does not show the font that showed well all this while since 2009.
