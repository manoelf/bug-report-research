Here is the deal: If I check the source of the page, and search for the problematic javascript content, the url looks like this:\n\nhttp://2leep.com/ticker2/1/custom/3/5/240/bottom/%23D8CDAA|black|Tahoma|1.4em|0.04em|15px|766|2813\n\nIts urlencoded, the hash is marked with %23 etc. IF I click on it and save with ctrl+s, the filename becomes:\n\n#D8CDAA_black_Tahoma_1.4em_0.04em_15px_766_2813.04em-15px-766-2813\n\nSaved, ok.\n\nIf I copy the src and paste it into firefox's url bar and try to save it, the filename becomes:\n\n#D8CDAA_black_Tahoma_1.4em_0.04em_15px_766_2813.04em-15px-766-2813.04em|15px|766|2813\n\nAnd can't save it, I get the file name is not valid.\n\nNow, the problem is, that with SAVE PAGE AS, Firefox incorrectly decodes the filename and try to save that, instead of saving it as an urlencoded string. So in correct it would look something like this:\n\n%23D8CDAA%7Cblack%7CTahoma%7C1.4em%7C0.04em%7C15px%7C766%7C2813\n\nSo, there is your fukken problem.
