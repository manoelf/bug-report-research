We need a way to shrink the rectangel in which the cues are displayed using CSS. \nThe webvtt features for positioning are not suitable for all usecases. As soon as we develope custom styleable controls, which are placed over the video element, we need a way to \"reserve\" this space for those controls. Due to the fact, that this is depending on the style of our webpage and our mediaplayer and not related to the contetnt of the vtt file, it has to be defined using CSS. For example:\n\n::cuedisplay {\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    right: 0;\n    bottom: 40px; /* space is needed for overlaying custom styleable controls at the bottom of the video */\n}\n\n2. There is no 'trackmode' change event.\nWhile we have a lot of special events for adding/removing tracks and cuechange/cueexit/cueenter. We do not have an event for the case, where a user changes the mode of a track. Again, this is for example needed for custom styleable controls. If the user changes the mode using the context menue from showing/disabled to disabled/showing we need an event for this to update for example the visual state of our controls. For example:\n\ntrack.addEventListener('modechange', function(e){\n    if(this.mode == 'showing'){\n        //do something\n    } else {\n        //do something else    \n    }\n});\n\nCurrently all custom styleable mediaplayers with track support, removedo not relay on the native implementations and handle the \"texttrack\" display with script.
