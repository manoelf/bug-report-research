I'm just getting really frusrated. i need a browser for my work (I'm a designer) and it's very important that the fonts render properly or I can't see things how they are supposed to look. The original problem with FF is as I first described. i first noticed on the Woothemes site, because the changes in typography were very obviously wrong.

We aslo checked it on other computes, bothr Mac and Pc running Firefox. Only FF 4 seemed to be ok.\n\nI don't understand what you have written in comment 3 because I'm not a programmer! But if you are saying that the coding of something at the woothemes site is wrong, why does Safari render it correctly?. If it was bad it should appear bad in all browsers, surely?\n\nI am seeing other parts of sites rendered in the wrong typefaces now too. But I cannot tell which is caused by FF and which is caused by a possible prolem in my own machine, since I cannot see anything without using a browser. All I can tell you is that I don't get the type problems in Safari. So some part of the rendering problem is down to a change in FF 5 and upwards.\n\nClearing the font cache only seemed to fix the problem of the font I saw when typing (the Bugzilla page problem).
