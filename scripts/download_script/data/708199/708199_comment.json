This works correctly if the grippy is clicked - the right side collapses/appears and the choice is remembers. However, if the user moves the splitter the \"state\" attribute becomes empty.

The splitter should set the state to \"open\" after being moved, that will allow it to be persisted correctly.\n\nRight now I have to use the following work-around in the splitter's \"command\" handler:\n\n  let state = splitter.getAttribute(\"state\");\n  if (!state)\n  {\n    splitter.setAttribute(\"state\", \"open\");\n    document.persist(splitter.id, \"state\");\n  }", "time": "2011-12-07T07:50:15Z", "attachment_id": null, "creation_time": "2011-12-07T07:50:15Z", "raw_text": "I have a splitter defined like this:\n\n  <splitter id=\"...\" persist=\"state\" collapse=\"after\" state=\"collapsed\">\n    <grippy/>\n  </splitter>\n\nIt is collapsed by default and its state is persisted.
