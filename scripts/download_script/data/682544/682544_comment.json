In both Safari and TextEdit, I choose some action via a menu, that brings a dialog, the action is not done yet, and the menu is no longer highlighted. Whether the dialog is a sheet or not. I find that logical, because in the dialog I may need a menu, like the Edit menu to paste or the Flag menu to enter characters. Furthermore, such a guideline would hinder the application menu (e.g.\u00a0the Safari menu) - used to hide\u00a0/ show the application and her comrades - and the system-wide menus like the Apple menu and the handy ones at the right (AirPort, Sound\u2026). But during the action I can anyway switch application thanks to the Dock and to Apple\u00a0Tab. So such a guideline would be inconsistent, Mac OS X is deeply multi-applications.\n\nAnyway, the action from the Window menu was\u00a0: switching to the dialog.
