Not mail server certificate handling, but web server certificate handling....\nWhen I receive an email with HTML content that tries to load resources (stylesheets, images) from a server over SSL whose certificate I don't trust, I get a big error/warning message that states that the \"Secure Connection Failed\"  because \"The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is not trusted.\"  \nThe only options available in this window are to \"View Certificate\" or \"Cancel\".  If I click on \"View Certificate\", there is no option to import it into my trusted certificates list....I can only export it.  It would be nice to have the ability to either import it directly from that message window or be able to confirm a security exception from that window. \nAlso - if I click Cancel, the window pops up again for as many resources as the email is trying to load.  So if I'm viewing an email that tries to load up numerous stylesheets or images, I get this certificate warning popup for as many resources that the Thunderbird is trying to securely load for viewing the email.  This is extremely annoying.\nIt would be nice if Thunderbird would only pop up with this message once instead of one time for every secure resource it tries to load for the HTML email.  Another option would be if I could tell Thunderbird to \"Ignore\" the certificate warning and it remembered that for the duration of the HTML load into the email viewing window.", "bug_id": 709065, "text": "So I've noticed an area for improvement with respect to certificate handling in Thunderbird.
