What ends up happening is the browser is directed to the image instead.  I assume that this will happen with any object in the page that shares the same name/id was the image.  Whichever object the browser encounters first will be where the link is directed to.  Please view the above URL to see the problem in action.\n\nNow, I was unable to find any information on standardization of object names and ids on the web, so perhaps it's just bad form for a designer to name two different objects the same thing.  But testing this in other browsers, I was unable to replicate the problem.  It may be that all the other browsers handle links to objects incorrectly and Firefox is the only one following standards, I don't know.  I was always under the impression that an href could only point to a named anchor or another page, not a specific object within a page.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create a page with a link, a named image, and an anchor of the same name\n2. Click the link.\n3.
