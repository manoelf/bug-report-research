The bug isn't easy reproducible. Hover over elements labelled \"wykop\" (eng: 'digg') for applied \"shadow on hover\" effect. You will have to try hovering over different elements and with different page widths (resize browser widnow).\nThe effect does not resize <article> box dimensions but still at some point <articles> will reflow between column layout. Since this is :hover effect and position of element changes its possible to trigger constant back and forth reflow (until fx crash).\n\nAlso can be reproduced by hovering over \"zakop\" elements (eng: 'bury') that shows absolutly positioned menu (doesn't change <article> dimension also) with bury reasons.
