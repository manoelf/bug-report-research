The aimed workflow in Win7 Aero is to smash your mouse pointer against the top of the screen and drag the whole program.\n\nCurrently there is some very small place where you can do it, but it really slows down workflow do to the aiming work, which only needs to be done in FF. the whole top of the titlebar in win 7 should be reserved for the Aero drag. It's one of the few good things MS has invented. Before that, one needed 3 moves where we need 1 move now when for instance moving a maximised window from one screen to another.\n\n\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. open many tabs\n2. while doing a lot of things, quickly (within half a second) drag a maximised window from one screen to another\n3. notice that firefox is handicapped, you only have a bit space at the left and right, not even in the corners of the screen but right before. It takes too much time and effort\n\nActual Results:  \nAnnoyance because the one needs to aim, where any other application allows to bang the mouse anywhere on top for dragging.\n\nExpected Results:  \nwithin less than 1/2 seconds, my maximised window should be  either maximised on a 2nd screen, or be unmaximised and placed where you want.\n\nThis was addressed for FF4 in Bug 624129, but it was tagged resolved and fixed without general agreement at all.
