A similar situation should be done for VectorImage.\n\nSpecifically, what we probably want to do is initially pause the animation controlled by nsSMILAnimationController. This will also cause the nsSMILAnimationController to deregister from the refresh driver. When a refresh tick occurs, the VectorImage's RequestRefresh() will set the current animation document time to the time period for which the call was made. FrameChanged() will not be called, because VectorImage already has special observers that get notifications when the invalidation would be done if the SVG document were to be viewed directly.", "bug_id": 685600, "raw_text": "As part of bug 666446, we moved RasterImage to the refresh driver based animation mechanism.
