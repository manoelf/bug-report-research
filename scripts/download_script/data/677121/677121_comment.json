With this support it'd be nice to have an entry in the right click context menu for copying the video URL including the current playback time as a media fragment URL. This would enable sharing the link to start playback at that position. The URL would look like:\n\nhttp://example.com/video.webm#t=10\n\nWhere '10' is the start position in seconds. A good name for the entry would need to be decided upon.", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "Bug 648595 adds temporal media fragment support to HTML video and audio elements.
