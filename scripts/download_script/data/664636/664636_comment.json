For example, many users do not use TLS-enabled configurations because they do not understand the advantages of TLS, at the time they first set up their email, their service provider didn't provide TLS, etc.\n\nAlso, recently some email providers have started offering IMAPS, POPS, and/or SMTPS over port 443 in addition to the standard IMAPS/POPS/SMTPS. This is a big benefit, because email over port 443 will work through many more firewalls than email over the standard ports will.\n\nSo, when we detect a sub-optimal configuration, we should offer to improve it for the user. For example, when we do update checks for Thunderbird, we can pull down updates to the server auto-configuration data, and then see if the current configuration for the user's servers is worse than the recommendations in the auto-configuration data; if so, we can ask the user to improve the security settings. Similarly, we can do this at installation time and/or when importing settings from other applications.", "author": "brian@briansmith.org", "tags": [], "time": "2011-06-16T01:37:08Z", "raw_text": "Today, many users have sub-optimal security settings for their email servers.
