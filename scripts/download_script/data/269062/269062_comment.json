Users that prefer interfaces and software in Basque\nor Catalan are also more likely to refuse Spanish or French nationality. So,\nredirection and, for instance, adding as a search option 'Display pages in\nSpain' is not really welcomed from these users.\n\nAnother point, you can only search pages in one definite language (a very\ninteresting and useful option for users) if you are in some certain local\ngoogles. For instance, I enable French as my default language (notice I'm in\nSouthern Catalonia), and in google.fr and google.com I can search for pages\nwritten in French, but not in Google.es.\n\nFinally, as I have already said, Catalan-speaking community thanks Google\ncompromise for Catalan language, and I think this gratitude could be extended to\nother less protected or minoritary languages. No doubt, Google is currently the\ninternational company which has shown a greater respect for these issues.\n\nI hope all the information I have written down may be used in the future for\nimproving localization policy in Google (and Mozilla, as well).\n\nBest regards,\n\n*Occitan is a language which is mostly spoken in French State, and currently\nofficial in one only place in the world, in Val d'Aran (in Southern Catalonia). \n\n(In reply to comment #20)\n> (In reply to comment #18)\n> \n> - first I wipe out all my google-cookies (in google.be and google.com),\n> otherwise Google would have used those\n> - With the default accept-language header (en-us,en;q=0.5), I receive a Dutch\n> language startpage (with a Belgian ipaddress).\n> - When I add French, and put it on the top, I receive the page in French\n> - when I move French to the bottom, so that English is on the top again, I\n> receive it in English\n> - when I remove French again, returning to the original setting, I receive the\n> page in Dutch again.\n> \n> Conclusion : it doesn't work for the default setting in en English-language\n> Firefox (en-us,en;q=0.5).
