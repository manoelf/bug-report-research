In Firefox 4.0 I notice the scrollbar for the Yahoo webmail inbox is missing. I cannot scroll up/down to see the contents of my inbox unless I use the page up and page down keys or the mouse wheel.  The preview mail window below does have a scrollbar.  If I double-click an email in the inbox view, a webmail tab showing a full-page with a vertical scroll bar is displayed and works to scroll up/down through my inbox.  In the previous Firefox version 3.6.15 the scrollbar was not missing.\n\nWhen I log into my Yahoo Plus account using either Firefox version 4.0 or the previous 3.6.15, the scrollbar was present in the inbox and in the preview window and the double-click webmail tab behavior all are displayed and work correctly.\n\nI also tested this using another \"free\" Yahoo webmail account. Using Firefox 3.6.15, the webmail inbox vertical scrollbar behavior was correct but using Firefox version 4.0 the scrollbar was missing.\n\nRestarting my PC did not resolve the problem and the behavior above has continued.  The problem does not occur when accessing Yahoo webmail through Internet Explorer version 8 browser.\n\nSteve\n\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. open and log in to Yahoo/Att webmail free account using Firefox 4.0\n2. click on inbox\n3. inbox vertical scrollbar is missing\n4. NO SPECIAL STEPS NEEDED\nActual Results:  \nthe webmail inbox vertical scrollbar is missing in the webmail account that comes with my ISP account\n\nExpected Results:  \nI expected the webmail inbox vertical scrollbar to be present as this is the correct behavior and the webmail has ALWAYS worked this way before and still does in the Yahoo Plus paid account\n\nthe Yahoo webmail free account that comes with my ISP account has an ad section next to the scrollbar in question. the ad section can be temporarily closed but it opens again shortly.  In the paid Yahoo Plus account, the ad section does not appear.  However, the missing scrollbar behavior is unique to the Firefox 4.0 and is not related to the ad section differences in the webmail accounts because the scrollbar behavior was correct in both accounts in Firefox version 3.6.15.\n\nNo themes are used.\n\nAdd-ons were the same in both Firefox 4.0 and 3.6.15 (e.g., No-Script, Show Parent Folder, .Net Assistant, Adobe Acrobat, iTunes Detector, Quicktime, Shockwave, Silverlight, Windows Presentation Foundation).", "raw_text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\n\nI am using the Yahoo/ATT webmail New, not Classic version of e-mail.
