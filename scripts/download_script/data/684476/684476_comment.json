Create a file called \"crash.htm\" in \"C:\" drive with the following simple code which contains the JavaScript that makes Firefox crash.\n(Open Notepad with Administrative Priviledges (Right click Notepad and click \"Run as Administrator), copy and paste the following code, click File-->Save. Type \"crash.htm\" as the file name and select \"All files\" from \"Save as type\" list.
