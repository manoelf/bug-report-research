When I CTRL-SHIFT-C to open my calendars and then right-click my GMail Cal and export it, it exports/saves the calendar as foo@gmail.com. Meaning, the file extension is .COM so Windows thinks it's an executable and TB doesn't recognize it as an ICS file so it won't import it on the Import dialogue screen so you're basically stuck going nowhere. I had to manually change the file extension to be foo@gmail.com.ics.\n\nAfter that, an import works just fine but GLACIALLY slow. So as far as I can see, this is working but needs some TLC as there's some bustage to the 1) export process resulting in 2) difficulty importing due to no appending of proper .ICS file extension to exported file and 3) SUPER SLOW importing.\n\nHope this is what you're looking for.", "raw_text": "So, minor issue with the STR in the year 2021.
