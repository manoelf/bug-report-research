I upgraded the linux version to TB5 and lightning 1.0b4.\n\n\nActual results:\n\nFrom the windows side all calendars were gone, just the error console showed a message for each calendar, saying it couldn't create the calendar because the method calICalender::id had failed. I found out: Lightning 1.0b4 had a timezones.sqlite of version 1.2011b and had set the version field of the cal_tz_version of local.sqlite to this value, whereas the 1.0b2 version on windows had timezones.sqlite version 1.2010i. I could make the calendars reappear and the errors in the error console disappear by either replacing the timezones version in local.sqlite with the old value or replacing 1.0b2's timezones.sqlite with 1.0b4's.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nLightning should never have silently ignored existent calendars with a more recent timezones mark. This signals to the user that he lost all his events. At least it should have shown a dialog saying that there are calendars based on more recent timezones information, and therefore have been ignored.\n\nAs a more recent timezones version in almost every case means no difference at all, and only in extreme rare cases some events can be off one hour (up to a maximum of 25 hours), I would rather prefer that those calendars should be loaded normally, but the user be warned by a dialog saying \"Your dates may be off up to 25 hours\", and explained why.", "tags": [], "time": "2011-07-05T19:04:00Z", "bug_id": 669406, "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0\nBuild ID: 20110622063727\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nI have a dual boot system (Ubuntu/WinXP), that share a common local.sqlite calendars file - I need my appointments on both systems.
