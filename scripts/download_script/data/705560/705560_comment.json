This should NOT occur. Linux includes 2 copy buffers, (1) the 'select' buffer which is automatically updated with the selected text each time a selection is made; and (2) the 'clipboard' or 'copy buffer' which is updated when a user selects text and chooses Edit -> Copy (or ctrl+c). The select buffer should not capture the source html format. Pasting from the select buffer is accomplish by simply pressing the middle-mouse button down, while pasting from the clipboard requires Edit -> Paste (or ctrl+v).\n\n\nActual results:\n\nFF's inclusion of html tags in the select buffer destroys the ability to use the select buffer to transfer information from FF to openOffice (OO) or libreOffice (LO) because it totally screws up the OO or LO document format by (i.e. pasting 64 pt. Red text into a spreadsheet cell, or destroying the writer paragraph format). The select buffer in Safari and Chrome works properly and does NOT capture the HTML format on selection.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nWith the number of office documents created today with information from the web NO browser should include the source HTML format tags in the 'select' buffer. At a minimum FF should provide an option in about:config that controls whether HTML format tags are include in the selection and it should be OFF by DEFAULT. A user should be able to take advantage of the Linux efficiency of copy/paste with a simple select and then middle-mouse paste using the 'select' buffer without having to change browsers to Chrome or Safari to do that. Currently with FF, there is NO way to do that. The only option is to (a) select the text in FF, (b) use the Edit -> Copy command to place the text into the clipboard buffer, then (c) left click in the OO or LO document to position the cursor, then (d) choose Edit -> Paste Special to activate the 'paste special' dialog; and finally (e) choose \"Unformatted Text\" from the dialog. That is NUTS. If FF properly excluded the HTML tags from the select buffer it would simply be (a) select the text in FF, and (b) middle-click in the OO or LO document to 'position & paste'. The failure to exclude HTML format tags in the select buffer forces the user though '4' additional steps just to paste text without source formatting with EVERY SINGLE copy/paste needed.
