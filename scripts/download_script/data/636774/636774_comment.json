The more straightforward solution was to call UpdateValueMissingForRadioGroup() and asking to just ignores self.\n\nI think a better solution would be to make the container update the radio elements validity itself: when a radio element has changed in a way that could make the validity changed, it would call the container and tell him to update its validity.
