It works for all my other applications and for Internet Explorer. I was trying to print shipping lablels from Paypal when the problem began yesterday. I have since uninstalled my printer and reinstalled it and all associated software but the problem persists. I have tested the printer twice and it is functional. After running several test prints I have found Firefox to be the problem. I an unassociated note I also have a problem with stereaming video and playing from a media player like Creative or Windows Media Player 11. I cannot acess any printer controls and the two problems seem interconnected. When I attempt to print I get the \"Save file to folder\" screen and it is followed by the message \"printer failed to print\". I also get the message \"file could not be sent to printer.\" This problemn continues after uninsrtalling Firefox and reinstalling it. I suspect an upgrade to this program may be at fault but because this problem appeared in the middle of a print job yesterday my suspicions are dubious. Everything else works fine and it is Firefox that is the problem. The question is how do I fix this?\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Open Firefox\n2. Go to any website or open any of my accounts with Paypal, etc.\n3. Try printing anything from Firefox.\n\nActual Results:  \nAfter selecting item or ordering the computer to print from a web page I get instructed to \"Save file to...\" from a save file popup window followed by the message \"printer failed to print\" when I close the window.\n\nExpected Results:  \nNo printout. A TON of frustration!!!\n\nThe computer should have printed what it was expected to. It never asked me to save anything before. Now I am forced to use Internet Explorer (OH GOD! THAT SUCKS TOO!
