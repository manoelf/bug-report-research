What may be helpful is a js stack at the point where it crashes to see if something is accessing the timezone service before it is loaded.", "creation_time": "2018-07-02T11:04:11Z", "raw_text": "> > I think this is some race condition / startup ordering thing.\n> > \n> > The timezone service and/or the UTC timezone isn't loaded and is therefore\n> > null, so I force a crash at that point.
