Since you'd have to individually rename the attachments, you'd have N popups (or a big popup with N fields). That's not much better than renaming individually, which you could easily do from the keyboard whenever that F2 patch gets pushed. The keyboard seems like the input method we should be optimizing for here, since we're expecting people to type stuff in. It would also *require* a new UI if we ever managed to make renaming happen without a popup, like Windows explorer.\n\nRemove All also doesn't seem that helpful. We have \"Delete all\" in the reader because any operation is actually changing the message immediately, which for IMAP means uploading the new message data. If you wanted to delete 5 large attachments, it would be really inefficient to do that as 5 steps. I think it's ok for \"Delete all\" to be performed as two steps: select all, delete. There's also a dataloss issue if you accidentally hit \"Delete all\", since we can't undo that (yet).\n\nOpen All would possibly work, though I'm not sure how useful it is to open attachments that you're attaching to a message. That seems like a pretty rare occurrence. We could probably get information about that from a Test Pilot study, though.\n\nMore generally, I don't think we really need to make the context menus the same for composition and reading, since the common actions for each don't seem to have a lot of overlap. Using the CRUD terminology, composition focuses on Creation and Updating, whereas reading focuses on Reading and Deleting. Again, Test Pilot data would help here, but I think consistency for its own sake here would just be creating a false equivalence between the two UIs.\n\nOn a more positive note, there are some things I think we *should* add to the context menus here: namely \"Cut\", \"Copy\", and \"Paste\". However, this means we'd have to write a bunch of code to work with the clipboard, and probably fix some core issues with OS integration.", "attachment_id": null, "time": "2011-12-04T21:29:02Z", "raw_text": "Rename All would be a bad UI, I think.
