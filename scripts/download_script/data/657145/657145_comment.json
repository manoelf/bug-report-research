More specifically, self.focus() appears to be ignored by FF when \u201cAllow scripts to raise and lower windows\u201d is not checked. As a professional developer, I have a good guess as to why the FF developers chose to not allow raising and lowering windows via JavaScript by default and think it may have something to do with \u201cpop-up-spam\u201d and if so then it\u2019s unfortunate that those developers of \u201cpop-up-spam\u201d have spoiled it for the rest of us developers whom intend to use an Internet browser\u2019s capabilities to develop applications desirable by all. My application uses windows a.k.a pop-ups as it main method of navigation. Basically, my application\u2019s main window contains a link which calls a JavaScript function when clicked. The JS function opens a new window. The new window attempts to self.focus() from within the new window\u2019s body onload event. All other Internet browsers including IE, Safari, Chrome, and Opera correctly bring the new window to the front using \u201cself.focus()\u201d while FF leaves the new window in the back unless also \u201cAllow scripts to raise and lower windows\u201d is checked. Furthermore, FF correctly prompts \u201cFirefox prevented this site from opening a pop-up window\u201d and when selecting \u201callow pop-ups for this site\u201d, FF does invoke the new window but does not seem to allow the new window to invoke the \u201cself.focus()\u201d method unless \u201cAllow scripts to raise and lower windows\u201d is checked. I think that FF not allowing \u201cself.focus()\u201d on user approved/allowed sites is anti-intuitive and therefore should be allowed. Assuming that FF chose to not allow scripts to raise and lower windows due to \u201cpop-up-spam\u201d then I think a compromise can be achieved that would both thwart \u201cpop-up-spam\u201d while also allowing scripts to raise and lower windows by default in a limited fashion. The compromise would be that FF would allow a window to be raised only once and cannot be raised from within a delayed event such as a timer when \u201cAllow scripts to raise and lower windows\u201d is not checked.

My sample code uses an <a> and the onmousedown event to open a new window. It\u2019s desirable to use the onmousedown event vs. onclick because onmousedown is actually faster than onclick due to onclick event firing when the mouse button is released while onmousedown fires when the mouse button is pressed without having to wait for the button to be released. The performance gained by using the onmousedown event vs. onclick is very noticeable for users whom tend to hold the mouse down longer than necessary but still measurable for those that click quickly. Again, my case is that my code is treated differently on only one Internet browser. It seems that a possible workaround would be to use the onclick event which appears to not suffer the problem where the new window is not in front and not focused but degrades performance due to the aforementioned and therefore not really a desirable solution.
