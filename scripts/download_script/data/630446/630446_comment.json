Since hardware acceleration only seems to be working on Win7, this makes me think that the sidebar effect is at least partly independent of hardware acceleration.  [The Speed Reading times are ~50X slower on OS X than on Win 7, making me believe that GPU-acceleration is not yet working for OS X; this is in contrast to Kraken scores which are actually ~30% faster on my OS X machine].", "raw_text": "(In reply to comment #2)\n> Perhaps hardware acceleration is playing a role here, testing with it on and\n> off would determine if that was the case.\n\nI see the sidebar slowdown on both Win7 and OS X.

On OS X, Minefield, Opera, Safari/Webkit and Chrome 10 all are quite slow in the Test Drive speed tests.
