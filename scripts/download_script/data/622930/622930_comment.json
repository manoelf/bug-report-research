If you're a bit too close when you move the cursor \u2014 you get accidental zooming even easier.)\n\n\n(If there is agreement, I'll file a follow-up bug)", "id": 5174523, "raw_text": "(This is a follow-up bug from bug 613909, which aims to disable the pinch-to-zoom gesture since it's very easily accidentally triggered, and stored permanently.)\n\nI think we should consider resetting stored site zoom preferences on devices that supported pinch-to-zoom, since it's error prone and hard to recover from if you accidentally triggered it, and don't know about the feature.\n\nAnecdotally, I've seen several \"Firefox displays this site with really small fonts, so I have to use IE instead\" cases, where the stored accidental zoom is actually what happened. \n\nIt's not going to be *too* onerous to adjust the sites you had it changed for again (IMO), and we reset it to normal size for people that are stuck in this state, and don't know how to get it back. \n\nI assume this mostly affects Mac laptops with trackpads, although there might be some Windows/Linux trackpads out there that do this too.\n\n(It's even easier to do the accidental zoom on the new Mac trackpads, since you don't have a physical button anymore, and tend to rest your thumb over the trackpad to click.
