When you chose a bookmark property there used to be an option to change the the favicon for the bookmark whenever there is an update to the bookmark web page. I could also configure the frequency and time the check should be made. I used to use this a lot to check if a web page has changed. It is very useful to track the careers page for companies that post any new jobs or to track a price for any product that you are following. This was a very unique feature that none of the browsers out there has. Can you please bring this feature back? Especially when Christmas is around the corner. I want to keep tabs on the sale price of the items that I want to watch :-).
