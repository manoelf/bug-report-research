Clicked on Help, Submit Feedback, Firefox Made Me Sad, entered description of problem, clicked Submit Feedback.\n\n\nActual results:\n\nEven though the Submit Feedback button visibly depressed (it moved \"down\" a few pixels), nothing happened.  The page didn't change, there was no error message displayed, no tooltip was displayed when hovering over the button.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nI realize now that this happened because my description exceeded the number of allowable keystrokes (140).  The page actually has a count-down of the number of available keystrokes left.  When you exceed 140, the counter goes negative and turns red, and the Submit Feedback button turns from green to grey.  HOWEVER, the button still acts as if it's active.  When you click it, it visibly \"depresses\" (it moves \"down\" a few pixels)  But no error message is displayed telling you why it's not working, nor is there a tooltip when you hover over the button telling you why it's disabled.  In the applications that I write, I always enable a tooltip when I disable a button, so that users can find out why it's disabled by hovering over it.  Yes, if I had noticed the counter had turned red that might have clued me in, but I didn't notice, and I think others might not notice either.\n\nMy enhancement suggestion:  When disabling the Submit Feedback button, add a tooltip to the button that describes why it's disabled (and, of course, remove the tooltip when re-enabling the button).  Also, if they actually Click the button when it's disabled, display a message box describing why it's disabled.", "count": 0, "tags": [], "time": "2011-08-18T17:05:26Z", "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0\nBuild ID: 20110811165603\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nFirefox 6.0.
