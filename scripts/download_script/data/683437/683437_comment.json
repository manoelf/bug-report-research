But a fraction of a second before the dropdown is shown, the tooltip is displayed, and then the dropdown is drawn over it. [If you look very closely, you can see the tooltip behind the OS X semitransparent menu.]\n\nEven worse, if you move the mouse by a pixel, the tooltip is redisplayed, this time _over_ the dropdown. It's tall enough to obscure the beginning of the first 3 history entries.\n\nI know I've used click-and-hold, but only recently noticed this... Not sure if 619930 made it worse by being multi-line, or if something else changed in more recent builds?\n\nPerhaps the more general fix here would be to make tooltips never display when the mouse button is down?
