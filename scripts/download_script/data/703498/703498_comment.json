This happens in the latest versions of FF (7.1.xxx) on both Windows 7 and Mac 10.7.\n\n\nActual results:\n\nAll works well if the user clicks the <a> link (thumbnail) only once, but should the user click two or more times, then the video plays for each click (although only the top one can be seen). If you pause the top video the sounds of the other video(s) continue(s).\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nI'm really quite new to all this, but based on performance in all other browsers I've tested this with (on Mac and Win), any extra calls to play the video should cancel out the previous calls. Or more simply, it's not good to play two versions of the video at the same time :o)\nHope you can help with this.", "attachment_id": 575383, "id": 5857395, "count": 0, "is_private": false, "creator": "denis@lol.hk", "text": "Created attachment 575383\nFirefoxQuery.zip\n\nUser Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1\nBuild ID: 20110928134238\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nI'm writing an HTML5 website, and, using a javascript function, call for a video to be played on a mouse click (please see the attached file).
