Hence i do alot of domain name change, redirection and so on so forth.

What i did was :\n\nGet hold of a domain you own : \nE.g : www.abcx.com\n\n1) Go to www.abcx.com\n - You should get a proper web interface as desired.\n2) Go into your domain control panel with ur isp (redirect www.abcx.com) to somewhere else\n3) Press 'F5' key on the same domain you browse using Firefox just now & you will get the old website again (not the new wan which is not desired, sounds like caching problem)\n4) But if you right click and press 'reload' you get the new content.
