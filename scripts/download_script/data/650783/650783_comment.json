The Mac version is the one that is not popping up the windows.\n\nThis worked fine in FF3.6.x.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.Open FF4\n2.Go to webmin instance on server that I want to edit\n3.Login\n4. Open the File Manager\n5. Select a file then click the Edit button.\n6. Nothing obvious happens.\n7.
