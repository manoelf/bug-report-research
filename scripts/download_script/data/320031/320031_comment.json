In order for our application to work properly, we have to configure FF to allow popups from the application's site, which at first, seems to work fine. The popus appear as expected.\n\nI have noticed that, after extended periods of use (several hours and the appearance of maybe 100 or more popup screens), I eventually encounter the message that \"Firefox has prevented this site from opening a popup\". If you click the \"Options\" button, the options available seem to indicate that poups are already allowed fromn this site (which they are). If you look at the list of sites from which popups are allowed, the application site is still listed. However, no popups are allowed from that site anymore. The browser will continue to operate in this manner (blocking all popups) until FF is closed and restarted, at which time the cycle begins again.\n\nThis condition has been observed on all released versions of FF since 1.0.0, and still occurs on 1.5.\n\nThis condition does not occur on the current release of Mozilla (1.7.11) nor has it been noticed on any of the previous releases. For this reason, I have been primarily been using the Mozilla browser instead of FF when accessing our application.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.
