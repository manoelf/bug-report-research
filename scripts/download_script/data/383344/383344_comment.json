a dozen times over the past month.\n\ni click on 'print all' whether the e-mail thread has one or > 1 e-mail item.  i am then confronted with a nice, printable page and a print window to select my printer and then click on 'print' button.  at times i cancel first, in order that i may check my 'page setup' first before committing to printing.  at times i just print head-on.\n\nthe status bar in the new small window that pops up showing the progress of the print job with firefox is active, scrolling across.  when it reaches the end, however, and one expects the small window to disappear to indicate successful completion of the print job, the window just sits there most of the time.  one expects that the window till close itself to indicate successful printing.  moments later, i click on the X to close this sub window, and a new window tells me that the firefox application is not responding, so i select force quit.  then, i bring up firefox again, sometimes restoring session, sometimes starting a new session.  either way, the second attempt usually lets me print a gmail item successfully.  more often than not, it takes the second attempt to print, not the first.  this is a bit annoying and disrupts flow.\n\nthanks for your help. \n\nReproducible: Sometimes\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. login to gmail account\n2. attempt to print an e-mail by clicking on 'print all', and waiting for print window to pop up\n3. either cancel the pop up (or not) if page set up needs to be checked/updated\n4. select print\n5. print progress mini window pops up and remains, indicating crash\nActual Results:  \nthe status bar in the new small window that pops up showing the progress of the print job with firefox is active, scrolling across.  when it reaches the end, however, and one
