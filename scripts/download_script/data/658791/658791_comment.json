In the \"Tasks\" tab I can include the \"category\" field, but the color of the category does not show up.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create new task category and assign it a color (Tools > Options > Lightning > Categories > Add > Check \"use color\" and select the color)\n2. Create new task, assign a category for the task\n3.
