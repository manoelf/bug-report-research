Sorry for my confusion.\n\n(In reply to Eric F from comment #0)\n> Created attachment 563088\n> Saved message with the offending header still in it.\n\n(1) Surrounding Content-Type: multipart/related doesn't have Content-Location.\n(2-1) Content-Type: text/html part has Content-ID: <0000>\n        Because this is for refer from other than this text/html part,\n        this shouldn't produce any problem in cid:URL resolution for this HTML.\n      An <img> in HTML has cid:2\n(2-2) An image/jpeg in same multipart/related has next header.\n        Content-Type: image/jpeg; name=P09-17-11_12.07.jpg\n        Content-ID: <2>\n        Content-Location: P09-17-11_12.07.jpg\n(3) Due to existence of Content-Location: P09-17-11_12.07.jpg, or due to different string in Content-Location: from Content-Id:, cid resolution by Tb fails to or doesn't associate cid:2 to \"Content-Id: <2>\".\n\nI don't know detailed spec of cid: resolution in such case.\nRFC says next only,\n  If cid: URL resolution reached absolutely same URL by resolution using\n  Content-Id: and Content-Location:, use Content-ID:(scope is mail data only)\n  instead of Content-Location:(scope can be out side of mail, e.g. Web site), \nalthough I think concept of cid:URL and Content-ID: requests cid: URL resolution with Content-Id: in this case.  \n\n(In reply to Edward from comment #6)\n> ------=_Part_2031963_10719891.1327015255467\n> Content-Type: text/html\n> Content-ID: <0000>\n> Content-Location:IMMS.SMIL\n\nIf I understand RFC correctly, Content-Location:IMMS.SMIL in this case is similar to <base> of HTML in URL resolution.\nSo, \"what should be\" depends on cid: URL in HTML and Content-ID:(and/or Content-Location:) of embed image. Without such data, nothing can be said on this case.\nAs for Content-Location:IMMS.SMIL of text/html part, I think it can be called \"malformed mail\", if the Content-Location:IMMS.SMIL header is placed without understading RFC.\n\nNo space between \"Content-Location:\" and \"IMMS.SMIL\" may produce other problem.\n\n(In reply to Edward from comment #7)\n> ------=_Part_3100134_9827541.1327159529529\n> Content-Type: text/html\n> Content-ID: <0000>\n> Content-Location: GCGP.smil\n\nBy te way, please don't paste long mail data.
