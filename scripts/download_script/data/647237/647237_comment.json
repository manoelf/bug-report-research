So if you have six iframes on a page displaying six different URLs, sometimes the iframes will display a URL that has been loaded into a iframe earlier on the webpage instead of the one given as a src.\n\nReproducible: Sometimes\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Clear the browser cache (ctrl+shift+delete -> cache)\n2. Load the testcase on http://sitedirect.se/iframes/iframes.html ( download: http://sitedirect.se/iframes/iframes.rar) several times.\n\nYou might have to load the page 100 times (sometimes it displays an incorrect iframe on the first couple of page loads, but sometimes you have to reload the page for a couple of minutes before the errors are shown.
