This worked fine from firefox 3.6 till 4.0.1, but after the upgrade to 5.0 today, something strange happens to these <audio>-tags.\nWhen I once press the play-button, nothing remarkable happens, it just plays the sound and then stops, as expected. But, if I press the play-button again, the grey space of the audio controls move down, and the buttons themselves disappear. Consequently, the audio cannot be accessed any more through the <audio>-tag. The javascript-functions, e.g. '~.play();' keep working, however.\nWhere this problem occurs when pressing the play-button two times, it also occurs when executing '~.play();' two times on one audio-element. The two times are counted per audio-element, so pressing the play-buttons of 'Score', 'Ping' and 'Koe' consecutively, once each, in the following example does not result in anything remarkable. Pressing all three again results in the bug, with all three the audio-tags going down. The bottom two audio-tags also have the same problem.\n\nScreenshots can be found at:\nhttp://www.mozbrowser.nl/forum/download/file.php?id=459&mode=view\n\nThe relevant HTML used is:\n<div class=\"timer\">\n   <div class=\"soundEffects\">\n      <div class=\"SE_view\">Score <audio src=\"src/_common/audio/naScore.wav\" id=\"SE_naScore\" controls=\"controls\" class=\"mini\"></audio></div>\n      <div class=\"SE_view\">Ping <audio src=\"src/_common/audio/ping.wav\" id=\"SE_ping\" controls=\"controls\" class=\"mini\"></audio></div>\n      <div class=\"SE_view\">Koe <audio src=\"src/_common/audio/koe.wav\" id=\"SE_koe\" controls=\"controls\" class=\"mini\"></audio></div>\n      <div class=\"clear\"></div>\n      <div class=\"SE_view\">Bel <audio src=\"src/_common/audio/bel.wav\" id=\"SE_bel\" controls=\"controls\" class=\"mini\"></audio></div>\n      <div class=\"SE_view\">Tik <audio src=\"src/_common/audio/tik.wav\" id=\"SE_tik\" controls=\"controls\" class=\"mini\"></audio></div>\n   </div>\n</div>\n\nWhen trying the code above, with no other content, it does the same as mentioned above, but the controls don't disappear when pressing play twice. The audio-tag just moves down, and is still accessable with the mouse. Maybe the controls disappear because of the width I set in the original example, the relevant css is:\naudio.mini {\n    float: right;\n    height: 28px;\n    margin-right: 30px;\n    width: 90px;\n}\n\n* {\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n}\n\nWhen inspecting the audio-tag with firebug, the blue 'position-marker' has another position as the actual audio-tag, which may also point to a cause of this problem. It seems the height of the audio-element is decided with no regard of the height given in css. Because the audio-bar is placed outside the audio-tag-space, it does not react.\n\nHope you can reproduce and solve it. Actually, I need this solved within a week for a presentation with firefox, but as I don't expect you to have it solved by than, I will try to work around that in a way, maybe with javascript or something.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Create an HTML-page with the HTML-code given in the details\n2. Run it in Firefox 5.0\n3. Press 2 times on 1 play-button\n\nActual Results:  \nThe audio-bar moves, and if a small width is given, it becomes inaccessable\n\nExpected Results:  \nIt should not move and remain accessable.", "raw_text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0\n\nOn a little website on my computer, not online, I have some <audio>-tags, which contain little sounds of 1 to 2 seconds.
