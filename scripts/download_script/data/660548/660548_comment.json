See the screenshot.  This shows a sequence of tooltips on several different elements.  The order of the images is the same as the order of triggering the tooltips, from top to bottom.  The first one is over the Tab Groups toolbarbutton and looks as it should, but each one after that has extra or missing chunks or lines.  These visual glitches can change over time for a given tooltip.\n\nI can't tell if the problem is in my add-on or in Firefox itself, but some of the details make it seem like a rendering problem.\n\nDetails:\n\n- this is with -moz-appearance: none on tooltips\n- a tooltip for a particular item can render fine the first time it shows, then have errors the second time it shows and from then on\n- it happens with all other add-ons disabled (i can't test it in safe mode, because obviously i need to be using this theme)\n- it happens with other themes too, and for other users\n- it's only with fx4 on the mac that it has problems\n- my same styling still works fine for fx4 on windows and linux, and the same code, unchanged, has worked fine for fx2 (windows), fx3, fx3.5, and fx3.6 (windows, mac, linux)\n\nSTR:\n1 - start Fx4 on Mac with a fresh profile\n2 - install NNL version 0.6.20110508\n  - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nasa-night-launch/versions/\n  - best to get it from the versions page, because that won't always be the latest version on AMO\n3 - restart using NNL\n4 - hover over any of the primary toolbarbuttons, looking at the tooltips; after two or three you should see what i mean\n\nExpected:\n- tooltips render as specified by CSS (dark text on a white body with black border)\n\nActual:\n- tooltips have rendering glitches, with extra or missing chunks or lines\n\nMozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; rv2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\nMac OS X 10.5.8", "bug_id": 660548, "tags": [], "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "Description:\n\nOn Fx4 for the Mac, tooltip rendering has a problem when running my add-on.
