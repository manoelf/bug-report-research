Even most core Bugzilla developers are in the dust when talking about group security.\n\nThere are several problems: there are products you can see (depending on MemberControl/OtherControl), products you can report bugs into (Entry), products you can edit bugs being into (Canedit), products which require you to restrict bugs to some group(s) (Mandatory/Mandatory), products which let you restrict bugs to some group(s) (Shown/* or Default/*), products which do not let you restrict bugs to some group(s) when you are not a member (*/NA) or for everybody (NA/NA), etc...\n\nThis brings so much complexity that admins either configure their Bugzilla incorrectly or do not try to use groups at all. Security is a major aspect of an application, and Bugzilla is by far not intuitive in that area; I even myself have to look at the source code from time to time to correctly understand how things work (from a dev point of view, we also have too many product and user methods related to group restrictions and product visibility, which is then prone to trigger errors when writing new code).\n\nIt's high time to simplify the way security works in Bugzilla, even if this means removing some use cases which are never or rarely used. Security management should be easy before being powerful (synonym of complex)!\n\nThe first step should be to merge the MemberControl and OtherControl settings into a single one.

These users have the right to create new products, but they are not experts. Our wish is that the administrators can configure a \"default setting\" for product group controls for new products. This way, the people creating new products doesn't need to modify these settings and we would avoid mistakes. For example, in the current configuration, our preferred default setting would be \"Mandatory/Mandatory, ENTRY\" for all new products for its own group, and \"NA/NA\" for all the other groups. It would be great if some default configuration can be created by the admins in the next version when these changes are made available.
