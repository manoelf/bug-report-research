{"bugs": {"664574": {"comments": [{"attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "Rather than restricting users to view data for only one domain at a time, SeaMonkey should allow users to select multiple domains.  \n\nWith SeaMonkey 2.0.14, I would sometimes review my saved cookies for pending expirations.  I started with the first cookie in the Cookie Manager window and used the down-arrow key, concentrating on the display of the Expires data.  \n\nWith SeaMonkey 2.1, I must select a domain (left pane), review its cookies (right pane), select another domain (left pane), review its cookies (right pane), etc (annoying pain :) ).  This requires frequent mouse actions that prevent continuous use of a down-arrow key.  This becomes most bothersome when I have many domains with cookies but each domain has only one or two cookies.  \n\nNewsgroup messages posted by others at mozilla.support.seamonkey have noted the equivalent problem with viewing login passwords via Data Manager.  If a user has a master password, it is indeed appropriate to require the entry of the master password to see what domains have login passwords; this requirement is met if the master password has been entered at any time during the current browser session.  It is also appropriate to require the entry of the master password to expose login passwords; this protects the login passwords of a user who temporarily leaves his or her computer and forgets that the master password has been entered.  For reviewing login passwords for several domains, however, the current design of Data Manager requires entering the master password again when the user selects another domain.  \n\nNote that viewing the login passwords for all domains all at once is not a security vulnerability.  Entering the master password would still be required to expose the actual login passwords.  As soon as someone has your master password, viewing login passwords all at once is no more a vulnerability than viewing them one at a time.  Instead, the vulnerability is in the compromise of the master password.  \n\nA capability that allows users to select multiple domains from the left pane of the Data Manager window (which would then allow users to select all domains) would resolve both issues: cookies and passwords.  Such a capability might also be useful to those who wish to view permissions and preferences in Data Manager.  \n\nImplementation might involve allowing the user to select one domain in the Domain list (left pane) and then hold down the Ctrl key while selecting other domains or hold down the Shift key while selecting the last of a contiguous set of domains.  At each step, the right pane would refresh according to what domains have been selected.  A similar implementation could be done for platforms whose keyboards lack a Ctrl key.", "time": "2011-06-15T22:12:06Z", "tags": [], "author": "david@rossde.com", "text": "Rather than restricting users to view data for only one domain at a time, SeaMonkey should allow users to select multiple domains.  \n\nWith SeaMonkey 2.0.14, I would sometimes review my saved cookies for pending expirations.
