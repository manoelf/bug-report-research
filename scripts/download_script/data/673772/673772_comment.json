For example, if I visited https://bugzilla.mozilla.org then the \"Equifax Secure Certificate Authority\" followed by the \"*.mozilla.org\" certificates would be in the CP history for that site.\n\nUpon a new visit to a previously visited site (even if normal history (e.g. cookies, cached pages, etc., were purged; and unless the CP history was purged) if the CP history for the previously visited site has no CP which matches the current visit certificate chain being offered to the browser, then the security indication in the URL bar shall indicate that the user should inspect it. A configuration option (setting) shall also allow the user to specify that in such cases a pop-up question will be given to him/her before actual content from the site will be fetched.\n\nOf-course, due to privacy concerns (which sites did I visit last?) the CP history purge should allow also to remove specific sites and/or CP entries for sites.\n\nBenefits:\n1.
