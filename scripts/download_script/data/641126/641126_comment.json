The styling is the same for Windows and OS X, and DOM Inspector claims the computed font-size on each is 13.6px. And comparing the first letter of each screenshot's snippet confirms that (\"W\" on Windows, \"F\" on OS X). A lowercase \"e\" on each is 8 pixels (exactly on Windows, 8-9 with OS X's antialiasing).\n\nIs this just an illusion due to the slightly different font rendering? Also note that your Windows screenshot appears to be a differently sized window and different snippet, so it's 4 lines instead of 2.\n\nStill a legit concern, illusion or not. (But would be good to do apples-to-apples comparison). A couple of things that could be done:\n\n1) Add Windows-specific styling to make the font smaller so it looks right, math be damned. (Might need to be version-specific, Windows Vista+ has nicer font rendering).\n\n2) Adjust the font size, for all platforms, based on window size. We already do a bit of this on the page.
