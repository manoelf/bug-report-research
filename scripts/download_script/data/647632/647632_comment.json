There are too many options, and one can't simply select a time zone by official name (or GST offset), they need to know the name of another major city in the specific time zone they want.\n\nFor example, if I am creating an event for a flight from San Francisco to Minneapolis and want to set the arrival time for that time zone, I click on the time zone for the end of the event. The default is whatever my default calendar time zone has been set to (as opposed to the system's time zone, its not clear why there is a difference), which is fine - in this case Los Angeles (as opposed to \"Pacific Standard Time\").\n\nNow I have to scroll through a list of continents, countries, and cities which is very long and difficult to navigate quickly. The list starts at the first entry, not my default time zone, so I have to scroll several pages until I find the general region I am looking for. Worse, the list is not comprehensive, so \"Minneapolis\" is not listed. That means I need to find another city in the list which is in the same time zone as Minneapolis. If I happen to know Minneapolis is in the \"Central Time Zone\" that is of no use because the name of the time zone is not an option. After looking at the name of every city in America I might guess that Chicago is in the same time zone as Minneapolis, but maybe I'm not sure without checking Google.\n\nWhy can't the timezone selection be more suitable widget or more simplified list, allowing you to start with your current (system) time zone, scroll through up or down one time zone at a time, and use official names?\n\nReproducible: Always", "creation_time": "2011-04-04T02:28:47Z", "is_private": false, "tags": [], "raw_text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.15) Gecko/20110307 Fedora/3.1.9-0.39.b3pre.fc14 Lightning/1.0b2 Thunderbird/3.1.9\n\nThe time zone selection feature when editing or creating a new event is very confusing and frustrating to use.
