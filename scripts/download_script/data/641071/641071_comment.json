Dragging a tab with no scrolling (right-most tab or tab from another window):\n-The tab insertion marker will either appear touching the right side of the right-most tab or a few (about 10) pixels to the right, approaching the arrow that scrolls between tabs.  If I hold the tab over the area in question, the insertion marker will jitter between these locations.\n\n2. Dragging a tab to the right as tabs auto scroll past:\n-The tab insertion marker will either appear in one of the two locations I described above, or jump all the way to the right-most edge of the window, or sometimes somewhere in between.  The insertion marker should not move past the edge of the region that shows tabs-- it should not move on top of the scroll arrow or all the way to the right.\n\n3,4. The same things will happen on the left side, like I described for the right side.\n\nThis only happens on the Mac version. The Windows version exhibits the correct (expected) behavior. I have not tested any Linux versions.\n\n\nReproducible: Always", "id": 5339864, "raw_text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\n\nThe blue tab insertion marker is buggy in a few cases.\n\n1.
