If we fire name change event for app tabs when title is changed like we do for normal tabs then perhaps we should do nothing here.\n\nOn the another hand highlighted app tabs is different than normal inactive tab with changed title because I always notice highlighted app tab but I may not ever know that inactive tab title was changed because title isn't shown entirely on inactive tab. So technically speaking highlighted app tab is not the same as inactive normal tab with changed title. Thus perhaps we should expose that in different way for AT.\n\nAlso app tab is kind of special tab, it's always visible and it should be important for user since it's permanent, so that if its title gets updated then probably it makes sense to notify screen reader users. This can be done on screen reader side or we could do that.\n\nPersonally I treat highlighted app tab as something happens and it needs my attention, for example, I've got new email or new tweet and etc.\n\nMarco, what do you think about that:\n1) Do AT users need to be notified when app tab title is changed?\n2) If yes then should we take care about this or is it work for AT?", "creation_time": "2011-01-11T09:17:40Z", "tags": [], "is_private": false, "text": "(In reply to comment #3)\n> (In reply to comment #2)\n> > But technically they are different: when page\n> > for not current app tab is updated then app tab is highlighted by blue color.\n> > It doesn't happen for normal tabs.\n> \n> They are *visibly* different, as they don't display the page title.
