Play the windows media file.  \n\nMake sure that you have Windows Scripting enabled in your Windows Medial Player settings!!\n\nThe browse will open up a new window with each slide.\n\n4. Repeat using IE.  This does not happen with IE.  Since we are not calling for a target=_blank with the WMP scripting, a new browser window should not be opening.  \n\nThanks!\n\nJT Daugirdas\n\nActual Results:  \nNew browser window opens when the embedded media script reaches each new URL link.\n\nExpected Results:  \nThe current browser window should simply scroll to the next slide on the same, already-opened web page.", "author": "jtdaugir@hdcn.com", "bug_id": 329995, "tags": [], "creator": "jtdaugir@hdcn.com", "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1\n\nI post medical lectures on the web.\nI have a script file that is embedded into a .wma audiofile.
