Then open page with FF to test.  This code is from a page that FF saved (a craigslist listing) with the content within the <head> tags left unchanged.  \n\nThe 15 second delay goes away when I remove the line that begins with \u201c<link type=\u201d.   \nThus I think this has something to do with the way FF saves header code.\nAgain, this will only cause a delay when \n1.
