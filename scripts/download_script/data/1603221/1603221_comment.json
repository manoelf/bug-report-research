Also have a policies.json file ready for insertion.\n\n1. Start off with a Windows device and install firefox 68.2 or higher (32 bit en-US). do not open firefox until policies.json file is placed in the distribution folder, and certs are placed in the certs directory I created.\n\n2. go into C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox\\distribution and place the policies.json in there to consume certificates. Do not open firefox.\n\n(note: my policies.json file consumes certificates from a directory called: \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox\\certs\" because the default path firefox uses to consume certificates requires a specific user name. I prefer to create the certs in the C drive where the path is not relative when creating in the \"%APPDATA%\\mozilla\\firefox\\certificates\" directory.)\n\n3. place the 14 certificates into \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox\\certs\", the policies.json file will point here and pull the 14 certificates. \n\n4. Open firefox and check the about:preferences and go to Privacy & Security to check the certificates.\n\n5. check about:policies to see if my certificates are enabled and spelled correctly\n\n\nActual results:\n\nI observe that only 5 of my 14 certificates are installed. I've even tried mitigating this by using the default directory for consuming certificates afterwards with the same results for versions 68.2 ESR and 68.3 ESR.\n\nI tested the normal versions (68, 70, and 71) and they all imported the 14 certificates, regardless of the directory (such as the firefox default certificates folder, and the one I created called \"certs\")\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nAll 14 certificates should have imported correctly.
