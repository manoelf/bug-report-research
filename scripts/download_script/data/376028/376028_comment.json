However, all the input fields are not fully usable. I can write text into them (for example the URL input bar) but I can not edit them properly. It seems that all the special keys are blocked like CRSR-Left/Right, PageUp/Down, Home/End, etc. Backspace and DEL works, and I can also klick with the mouse in the edit field and position the cursor this way. This does not only apply to the URL bar, it also applies to edit fields that might be available on a site that I open with such a window. The only solution to resolve this issue, that I found is, to press CTRL-S then the save file dialog appears. When I click cancel on it after that, all the fields work like normal and I can use these special keys. This also doesn't happen when I use the menu entry File->New Window, only when opening a new window with the keyboard shortcut.\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.Start Browser\n2.Open another browser window using CTRL-N keyboard shortcut (NOT VIA THE MENU!)\n3.Klick in the URL edit field and write some text (no need to press Enter)\n4.Try to use the cursor left/right or Home/End keys to navigate/edit the text.\nActual Results:  \nThe cursor doesn't move.\n\nExpected Results:  \nThe cursor should move as is to be expected in an editable field.\n\nAs mentioned in the main text, this only happens when using the keyboard shortcut CTRL-N.", "id": 3149594, "bug_id": 376028, "text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3\n\nOn Linux I couldn't reproduce this problem, so it might be a Windows only issue.\nWhen I open a new browser window with CTRL-N a new window pops up (as it should).
