Why is that important on the pipeline side?\n\nIt's good for saving client bandwidth and it's good for saving some cost on the pipeline side in terms of having fewer bytes to move around in the first few hops of the pipeline before we've parsed the payload. So it's an expectation only in the sense that if the client _can_ gzip the payload, it's good for everyone if they do.", "time": "2020-05-06T15:45:26Z", "text": "(In reply to Alessio Placitelli [:Dexter] from comment #0)\n> Jeff, you mentioned that as an expectation for the pipeline.
