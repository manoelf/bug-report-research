It may take a while for people to realise that (i) FF4 has a new feature called hardware acceleration and (ii) that it affects the way text looks.

Regarding \"double l's\" and similar observations: with h/w accel off, it's expected that every instance of \"l\" in a string of text will look the same, with identical antialiasing (whether good or bad!). This is because the position of each glyph is forced to align to the pixels of the display, so the outline gets rasterized and antialiased in the same way every time. (Well, I expect a cached bitmap is used internally.) With h/w accel enabled, however, subpixel positioning is supported, which means that glyph positions are NOT snapped to the boundaries of display pixels. And therefore successive examples of the same glyph may be rendered differently, depending on the relative alignment of the glyph outline to the pixel grid. Individually, some glyphs may be similar to their pixel-aligned versions; some may be \"better\", at least in the sense that the perceived shapes are more true to the original font design; and some may turn out worse. But overall, the key difference is that the glyph shapes and spacing will be more consistent. The price we pay for this is that they may appear less \"sharp\" because the outlines are not being forced to fit the pixel grid, and therefore there are fewer precise, strongly-defined edges.\n\nAn aside, perhaps not directly related but a significant difference between IE9 and FF4: as far as I can tell, IE9 does not seem to be applying any kerning in Latin-script text, whereas FF4 does. As an example, try <p style=\"font-family:arial; font-size:100px;\">AVAVAVAV</p>, and note how Firefox applies the kerning (defined in the Arial font) between the \"AV\" and \"VA\" glyph pairs. I noticed this in the screenshots from xbuk.co.uk, where we can see Firefox applying kerning to the text.\n\nWe have a known problem involving antialiasing and transparency, as noted above (Bas definitely knows more about that than I do!) - the classic example of this is the URL bar, which shows bad color fringing (\"rainbow\" effects) if you enter something like \"llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll\".\n\nI'm not able to reproduce some of the examples cited here: I looked at www.reikimacedonia.com (see comment #13), and the rendering I get with IE9RC and FF4beta is virtually identical.

Shut up and use an other browser?\n\nThis bug is called \"Text using hardware acceleration looks inferior to and considerably different from text with acceleration disabled and on other browsers\" and that's exactly what thousands of people (see the comments above) are complaining about. It's insanely blurred with ClearType disabled (see bug 719410) but also bad with ClearType enabled (which is this bug). I'm very sorry but I don't understand why Mozilla focuses on using Firefox as a playground for experimental features while at the same time core features like displaying text are broken since version 4.\n\n(In reply to Bas Schouten (:bas) from comment #136)\n> other developers than myself did an\n> extensive survey amongst a large group of users to determine which fonts are\n> preferred in [what] rendering.\n\nWhat survey? What people participated in that survey? From what countries? How where these people selected? How did you distinguish people who really care about readability from people who didn't care and just clicked what looked pleasant and cushy?\n\n> There's additional settings that\n> can be tweaked also from about:config, to keep HWA on, but use different\n> rendering modes for fonts\n\nTo use a famous quote: \"Don't Make Me Think\". There is no setting in the configuration dialog except for disabling all hardware acceleration. I will not mess around with some strange numbers in about:config. Same problem with the \"Anti-Aliasing Tuner\". It's mess of confusing checkboxes.
