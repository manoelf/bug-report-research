It is up to curators of the IANA Language Subtag Registry to determine whether a particular ISO 3166 is appropriate for use in a language tag. They have determined that certain reserved codes are appropriate and certain ones are not. (You'll note, for example, that reserved code 'UK' is not in this list, because 'GB' is the code that should be used.)\n\nWith that being said, this list is generated from the region subtags listed in the IANA Language Subtag Registry, with the deprecated and private use subtags removed. (It is actually debatable whether we want to exclude the deprecated subtags, but we made the decision to do so.)\n\nThe files involved in generating this patch are here:\nhttps://github.com/GPHemsley/BCP47/blob/master/get_subtags.py\nhttps://github.com/GPHemsley/BCP47/blob/master/region.txt\nhttps://github.com/GPHemsley/BCP47/blob/master/regionNames.properties\nhttps://github.com/GPHemsley/BCP47/blob/master/regionDeprecated.properties\nhttps://github.com/GPHemsley/BCP47/blob/master/makefile#L67\nhttps://github.com/GPHemsley/BCP47/blob/master/regionNames-l10n.properties\n\nI should also note that some of the English names have been overridden from the names that are listed in the registry.\n\nThe regions in question are here:\nhttps://github.com/GPHemsley/BCP47/blob/master/get_subtags.py#L213\n\nMy original justification for these choices is here:\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.l10n/browse_thread/thread/97d2dddb8db97248/1231aceeaf2cfc06\n\n(Note: Some of the \"renames\" I justify in that thread merely involve reverting to the name used in the registry.
