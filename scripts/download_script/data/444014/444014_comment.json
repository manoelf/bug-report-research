It has very little practical usage, especially in context where we know what the correct intent to use is. Give we're talking about a web browser, RelCol + BPC is most appropriate for mimicking Photoshop. If Perceptual worked as well as everyone would like, and maybe as well as v4 promises, then I'd suggested Perceptual as the default. It's better if the designer could specify this in the document, rather than the image because the image is a different thing than its usage in context.\n\n\n\n> but I think in practice the net\n> effect of not doing so would be to occasionally have whites rendered with a\n> blueish tint.

Another solution outside of a CSS3 context is not needed in my opinion. I think W3C's backtracking on ICC implementation is unfortunate, although I'm glad to see what was suggested has been canned. I think there is a rational middle ground that will not take much coding, is forward thinking and extensible.\n\n> It's unclear\n> as to whether or not Safari respects intent flags at all, but if it does it\n> certainly overrides absolute colorimetric intent (the test cases display\n> properly).\n\nI think it ignores the intent flag, and uses Perceptual.\n\n\n> Do you forsee a problem with any of the other intents (relative, perceptual,\n> saturation)?\n\nRare.\n\nIn the case of current sRGB profiles that conform to the ICC v2 spec, and display profiles that largely also conform to the ICC v2 spec, there is no difference between the other three intents when using a conventional CMM, including lcms. For now. There is plenty of allowance in all versions of the ICC spec to perform CMM based intelligent gamut and dynamic range mapping, which could be different depending on the intent selected. In my view it's unlikely this will be an issue over the course of the next 3 years.\n\nHowever, with ICC v4 source and or destination profiles, there can be differences between the intents. most of the time they are subtle.\n\nIn any event. the use case here is more strongly in favor for Perceptual as a default unless explicitly set to something else.\n\nNote that RelCol + BPC is in effect a fifth rendering intent because it is a default intent in Adobe applications both for display and for print. And yet it has no official status in the ICC spec, therefore it isn't an option for the intent flag. The vast majority of users are expecting RelCol + BPC, and what is embedded in the images by Photoshop is RelCol (no placeholder for BPC). So if you cannot replicate BPC, you should use Perceptual in any case.\n\nAn argument could be made for the remaining intent: saturation. But most vendors duplicate the perceptual intent table in the saturation intent table.\n\n *shrug* \n\nI will bet there are 5 people on the whole planet, minus Adobe employes, myself, and anyone reading this, that has any notion that they can set the intent flag using Photoshop...\n\nI'd pick Perceptual as a default, and compel the W3C to implement optional support for overriding it via a CSS3 property.\n\n\n> If not, it's probably best to leave them be and only regulate the\n> absolute flag.

As a default. I still think CSS3 needs to allow for overriding this.\n\nBut one thing is for sure is that 3.1.1 section on gamma compensation is useless.

If Perceptual worked as well as everyone would like, and maybe as well as v4 promises, then I'd suggested Perceptual as the default. It's better if the designer could specify this in the document, rather than the image because the image is a different thing than its usage in context.\n\n\n\n> but I think in practice the net\n> effect of not doing so would be to occasionally have whites rendered with a\n> blueish tint.

Another solution outside of a CSS3 context is not needed in my opinion. I think W3C's backtracking on ICC implementation is unfortunate, although I'm glad to see what was suggested has been canned. I think there is a rational middle ground that will not take much coding, is forward thinking and extensible.\n\n> It's unclear\n> as to whether or not Safari respects intent flags at all, but if it does it\n> certainly overrides absolute colorimetric intent (the test cases display\n> properly).\n\nI think it ignores the intent flag, and uses Perceptual.\n\n\n> Do you forsee a problem with any of the other intents (relative, perceptual,\n> saturation)?\n\nRare.\n\nIn the case of current sRGB profiles that conform to the ICC v2 spec, and display profiles that largely also conform to the ICC v2 spec, there is no difference between the other three intents when using a conventional CMM, including lcms. For now. There is plenty of allowance in all versions of the ICC spec to perform CMM based intelligent gamut and dynamic range mapping, which could be different depending on the intent selected. In my view it's unlikely this will be an issue over the course of the next 3 years.\n\nHowever, with ICC v4 source and or destination profiles, there can be differences between the intents. most of the time they are subtle.\n\nIn any event. the use case here is more strongly in favor for Perceptual as a default unless explicitly set to something else.\n\nNote that RelCol + BPC is in effect a fifth rendering intent because it is a default intent in Adobe applications both for display and for print. And yet it has no official status in the ICC spec, therefore it isn't an option for the intent flag. The vast majority of users are expecting RelCol + BPC, and what is embedded in the images by Photoshop is RelCol (no placeholder for BPC). So if you cannot replicate BPC, you should use Perceptual in any case.\n\nAn argument could be made for the remaining intent: saturation. But most vendors duplicate the perceptual intent table in the saturation intent table.\n\n *shrug* \n\nI will bet there are 5 people on the whole planet, minus Adobe employes, myself, and anyone reading this, that has any notion that they can set the intent flag using Photoshop...\n\nI'd pick Perceptual as a default, and compel the W3C to implement optional support for overriding it via a CSS3 property.\n\n\n> If not, it's probably best to leave them be and only regulate the\n> absolute flag. What would suggest changing it to? My gut vote would be to go\n> for perceptual, but again I think you have more experience in this department.\n\nsRGB to most display profiles today there will be no difference unless AbsCol is called.\n\nMoving forward with v4 display profiles, and increasingly a v4 sRGB now in public beta by the ICC, Perceptual. As a default. I still think CSS3 needs to allow for overriding this.\n\nBut one thing is for sure is that 3.1.1 section on gamma compensation is useless.
