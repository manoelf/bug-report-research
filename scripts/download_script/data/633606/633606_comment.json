However, I see this problem with any software installer file that has the .exe file-extension.  \n\nWhen I select the location into which Download Manager should save the file, I get a download progress popup.  The popup says that downloading has been canceled.  I then select the tiny retry button (the circular arrow).  Downloading then occurs.  When I look at the downloaded file, it has 0 size.
