If user wants to open bookmark manager from here, he first has to open another tab to make Firefox button appear\n\nRunning: Ubuntu 10.10, opensuse 11.3, ion3-20090110\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Start Firefox.  Blank tab page should be loaded with toolbar properly visible\n2. Using a window manager keyboard shortcut*, make Firefox  full-screen.  Toolbar still visible.\n3. Try to make Firefox go back to windowed mode using the same keyboard shortcut.  Window flashes something on tab so fast it can't be recognized\n4. Use the fullscreen keyboard shortcut a third time.  This time Firefox listens and goes back to windowed mode\n5. Click the blank tab to give it focus.  \n6. Toolbar not visible.\n\n*This ion3 setup is heavily customized: toggle-full-screen shortcut is bound to the \"WGroup.set_fullscreen(_, 'toggle')\" Lua command.  Not sure if there's binding for it in vanilla Ion3", "attachment_id": 524471, "creator": "jboriss@mozilla.com", "time": "2011-04-07T20:37:47Z", "id": 5395016, "is_private": false, "raw_text": "Running: Ubuntu 10.10, opensuse 11.3, ion3-20090110\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1.
