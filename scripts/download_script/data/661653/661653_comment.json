I reduced it down to a simple SVG testcase (attached). When I scroll the object out of view, and then scroll it back into view, sometimes I get horizontal lines parallel to the scroll line and through the endpoints. Scrolling around some more or alt-tabbing make them go away, which makes me think it's an invalidation bug.\n\nThe really weird thing is that this occurs in Webkit (chrome + safari) as well as Firefox, which makes me wonder if there's some common GFX code between the engines on OSX.
