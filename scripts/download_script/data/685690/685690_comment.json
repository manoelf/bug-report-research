I ignored it until today. Today I decided that I should tell the product team about it, but discovered that there is no trivial way to do it!  So below are two things combined, product feedback and website feedback or in other words - Ideas to improve the product and an idea to improve feedback channel.\n\nFeedback channel:\nAs I mentioned above, I couldn't find a direct and simple way to provide feedback. I starting by looking for an option in the product menu, but couldn't find one. Then I went to the website and that wasn't trivial as well as you can see the steps I made, which are described in 'The path of feedback' section below.\nFrom this experience I would like to propose:\n1. Add to the Thunderbird Help drop-down menu a feedback option (similar to firefox->help->report a problem).\n2. Have a bold link in the website that invites users to leave feedback\n3. Separate the interconnection between Thunderbird website and Mozilla, which is a Firefox oriented website. Or at least notify that the links are not thunderbird specific (see steps described in 'The path of feedback' section below)\n\nThe path of feedback:\nI was searching for a place to leave a feedback. My steps were as follow:\n1. http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/\n2. clicking support -> http://support.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/home\n3. Confusing page (the word feedback is not even on the page!), clicked contact us (low low in the page) ->\n4. A map! (unexpected, but ok...) -> scrolled down to 'Tell Us What You Think' -> product feedback\n5. A firefox feedback page! pressing back in the browser, maybe I clicked the wrong link. no it is the right one.\n6. Pressing website feedback have brought me to write this mail.", "creation_time": "2011-09-08T21:21:34Z", "text": "Here's a bug report from the webmaster email address:\nBackground:\nI have a found something that caused me frustration, while using search option in Thunderbird more than once.
