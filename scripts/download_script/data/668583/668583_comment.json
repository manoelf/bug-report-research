I have the beginnings of some extensive breakpad instrumentation, but (1) it's a major change, would require extensive review, and I would be surprised if it wasn't accepted at all; and (2) there's no guarantee it would actually turn up anything useful.\n\nBacking off from that, there just isn't enough information in this bug to do much. I can turn on some lightweight assertions in this code to make it crash slightly sooner, but the problem here is that heap memory is getting corrupted, and when GC scans it, it either is or is interpreted as a rope, and it's an invalid rope.

So fc0c4 is just a fancy form of zero, and doesn't really tell us much. The crash I looked at (on fc0c4) is at the instruction that reads the mark bit, so what's happening is that a random (non GCthing) pointer is having its \"mark bit\" checked, and the computation to find that mark bit gives the invalid address.

If you can figure out any sort of pattern that causes this bug to be more likely to happen, it could provide a helpful clue.
