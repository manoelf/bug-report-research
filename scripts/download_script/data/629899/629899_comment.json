Could we instead remove the mirror attribute when the page is completely done loading?", "time": "2011-01-29T16:12:19Z", "creator": "jag+mozilla@crivens.net", "attachment_id": null, "author": "jag+mozilla@crivens.net", "text": "From bug 628654 comment 59:\n\n  saneyuki_s 2011-01-29 07:28:40 PST\n\n  In the current implement of status messages, if mouse hovers on\n  the messages on left side, the messages is switched to right side.\n  However, I seem that this implement is hard to use for wide-screen...?\n  It is too big to move line of sight?\n\n\nMaybe an easy fix is a CSS transition where you can see the status move from one end to the other?\n\nOn a related note, certain pages will end up setting the status text to the empty string during page load (I see this on e.g. YouTube) so we remove the mirror attribute.
