It's a special mode of Gecko's HTML parser, so there's no obvious way to just \"enable\" JS, etc. support.  Something would need to parse the JS, emit tags for highlighting, etc. which editors already know how to do.\n\nOne problem we'd have to contend with is that the current HTML view source is able to handle very large documents efficiently because of its design.  Some people (at least bz, IIRC) would be sad if the new approach was slow for these cases.\n\nSome day this could also tie into our plans for a resources view in the toolbox, in which case it could be a true editor, not just read-only.", "creator": "jryans@gmail.com", "tags": [], "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "(In reply to Jeff Griffiths (:canuckistani) from comment #3)\n> If we do this, are we considering doing it for html view source as well?
