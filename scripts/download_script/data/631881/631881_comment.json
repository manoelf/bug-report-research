Unless\nthe tab preview is transparent (it's not for me), the arrow will be obscured\n50% of the time.\n\nPlus, bottom-up indicators in a top-down UI feel both out-of-place and awkward.\n\nSuggestion:\nRevert changes made in Bug 606909. Instead, change the top margin to be 0px, so that the tab indicator is drawn within the tab bar at the top of the tab.\n\nEnd result:\nTab drop indicators are no longer obscured by the title bar, fall off-window, or are covered by tab previews.\n\nAlternate, more flashy/modern suggestion:\nRemove the drop indicator arrow altogether. Instead use a colorized gradient/glow on the edges of the tabs indicating the drop area.\n\nReproducible: Always", "creator": "sparky@bluefang-logic.com", "bug_id": 631881, "text": "User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0b12pre) Gecko/20110205 Firefox/4.0b12pre\nBuild Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0b12pre) Gecko/20110205 Firefox/4.0b12pre\n\nSee Bug 606909 Comment 23\n\nPutting the indicator arrow beneath the tab seems like a bad idea to me.
