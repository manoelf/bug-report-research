This only appears for a second or less and then reverts back to black/transparent.\n\nIf I then return to the first machine and log back in locally, firefox still has the issue.  \n\nChanging firefox themes causes the tabs to be accessible and look correct again, but the < and > arrows and all the controls are still transparent and inaccessible.  IN this state the tabs work but some of the tab bar may look correct, some transparent and some black.  See screenshot ff-task-bar-glitch.PNG\n\nThe only solution is to completely close firefox and re-open it. \n\nHappy to help troubleshooting this, if I can be of assistance.\n\nThanks!"}, {"raw_text": "", "creator": "jboren@drakecooper.com", "text": "Created attachment 8940322\nView of glitching firefox tab bar with normal, black and transparent areas", "time": "2018-01-05T20:20:04Z", "count": 72, "creation_time": "2018-01-05T20:20:04Z", "tags": [], "attachment_id": 8940322, "bug_id": 656891, "is_private": false, "author": "jboren@drakecooper.com", "id": 12948127}]}}}
