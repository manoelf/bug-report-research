That means it needs to reload the page every time as it is always expired.\n\nSo, I am not knowledgeable enough to know if Firefox really behaves in this way and whether that is correct according to a specification.

We get quite enough of that BS from politicians. The check box reads: \"don't load tabs until selected.\" therefore, the tabs should not load the file when FF starts and remain in that state until the tab is selected.\n\nIf you change the functionality, then change the description to \"Tab Loads Options\" and have options that the user can select for their personal preference.\n  * Don't load tabs until selected\n     - Current functionality\n  * Load tabs from server on start\n     - loads tabs directly from server when FF starts\n  * Load tabs from cache on start\n     - loads tabs from cache when FF starts\n  * Reload tab when selected\n     - Issues an F5 for the newly selected tab.\n     - Reload list to specify which tabs to reload when selected.\n\nThese options would enable a user to configure FF in a way that is most efficient for their surfing habits.\n\nScott A.

The tab that is open when I start\nfirefox which is typically my yahoo email page refreshes and shows me that I have new email.\n\nIn addition, every tab that I select to view the contents, refreshes, I do not need to press\nthe f5 key unless I am on a site that does not have an auto refresh script on it.\n\nI have (don't load tabs until selected) checked in the options tab settings.\n\nI never see snapshots unless the tab was already viewed in which case I must press the f5 key to \nrefresh the page.\n\n\n> Who cares if the browser starts faster if I have to reload the page \n> once it has finished loading from cache???\n\n\nEveryone who has experienced a browser crash because of a bug in a script on some page that is being refreshed even when that particular tab is not the current tab.\n\nConsidering the fact that you cannot view the contents of any given tab until you select the tab,\nit is far better to prevent refreshing of that particular page until it is selected. In this way,\nif the browser doe happen to crash because of a script update, you know which tab contains the \nbuggy script and can close it before it fully refreshes on the next browser start.\n\n\n> Most users don't know this is happening to them, do you think is that right? \n\nYes, because most users do not know how to figure out which web page is causing\na browser crash due to an updated script. Those users blame the browser first and\nthe web developer never.\n\n> do you think performance is a reason to hide the real content of a web page?\n\nYes, but performance is not the only reason, as I said previously, delaying \na page refresh until the tab has been selected insures that if the page script\nhas been updated with a bug that can cause a browser crash, you will know exactly\nwhich page you were on when the browser crashes. I infer that you have not run \ninto this situation. I have, and I can assure you, it is a pain.\n\nDelaying a page refresh also helps those who have dial up or low end \nDSL services. They are not able to download all the tabs that they may\nhave open at a single time. Delaying a page refresh also saves on bandwidth. \nIf you leave a website open in a tab that you visit indiscriminately, you do \nnot need that tab to refresh until you actually select it to view the site.\n\nTake care.", "count": 34, "bug_id": 706970}, {"raw_text": "We are not talking about lazy load, we are talking about loading from cache.\n\nOpen http://www.forocoches.com/foro/forumdisplay.php?f=2\nWait a few seconds and close firefox.\nOpen firefox again (restore last session option should be active) and you will see an outdated version of that board.

The browser usually tries to use all types \n> of cache as much as possible and adds an \"If-modified-since\" header to the request. \n> Opera differs by sending a \"Cache-Control: no-cache\".\n> \n> CTRL-F5 is used to force an update, disregarding any cache. IE7 adds an \"Cache-Control: no-cache\", \n> as does FF, which also adds \"Pragma: no-cache\". Chrome does a normal \"If-modified-since\" and \n> Opera ignores the key. \n\nAs I've written in comment 2, currently, most of the time \nthe user needs to press F5 (or the \"Reload current page\" button) in restored tabs \nin order to get updated content (F5 will suffice - Ctrl+F5 is not needed).\nNote that only Ctrl+F5 disregards any cache.\n\nSo, I think that a solution to this issue would be, \nwhen selecting a tab and it loads (due to the \"Don't load tabs until selected\" behavior), \nFirefox to load it via performing an \"F5\" action, i.e. a refresh\n(I don't think that this is what is currently happening).\nThis way I believe that restored pages would always be up-to-date, while still making use of cache if available.\nAnd because since Firefox FF 47 [2] the \"Don't load tabs until selected\" is the default behavior, i.e. Firefox will wait until you select a tab before loading it,\nI think that this won't have any significant impact on the performance of reloading restored tabs, and that's because only 1 (non pinned) tab is restored at any time, i.e. as you select it (not all tabs, simultaneously).\nIn any case, maybe provide my suggested behavior as an setting/pref.\n\n\n\n[1] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/385367/what-requests-do-browsers-f5-and-ctrl-f5-refreshes-generate\n[2] https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/allow-firefox-load-multiple-tabs-background", "time": "2016-09-09T17:07:42Z", "bug_id": 706970, "tags": []}, {"id": 11699922, "raw_text": "(In reply to Kostas from comment #48)\n> Based on [1] :\n> \n> As I've written in comment 2, currently, most of the time \n> the user needs to press F5 (or the \"Reload current page\" button) in restored\n> tabs \n> in order to get updated content (F5 will suffice - Ctrl+F5 is not needed).\n> Note that only Ctrl+F5 disregards any cache.\n> \n> So, I think that a solution to this issue would be, \n> when selecting a tab and it loads (due to the \"Don't load tabs until\n> selected\" behavior), \n> Firefox to load it via performing an \"F5\" action, i.e. a refresh\n> (I don't think that this is what is currently happening).\n> This way I believe that restored pages would always be up-to-date, while\n> still making use of cache if available.\n> And because since Firefox FF 47 [2] the \"Don't load tabs until selected\" is\n> the default behavior, i.e. Firefox will wait until you select a tab before\n> loading it,\n> I think that this won't have any significant impact on the performance of\n> reloading restored tabs, and that's because only 1 (non pinned) tab is\n> restored at any time, i.e. as you select it (not all tabs, simultaneously).\n> In any case, maybe provide my suggested behavior as an setting/pref.\n> \n> \n> \n> [1]\n> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/385367/what-requests-do-browsers-f5-and-\n> ctrl-f5-refreshes-generate\n> [2]\n> https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/allow-firefox-load-multiple-tabs-\n> background\n\nI have been getting the activity you described for several years.\n\nMy yahoo email sorts my email into folders and I always made sure \nthat bot spam and trash is deleted.
