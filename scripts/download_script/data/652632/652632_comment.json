This causes the backend to create duplicate records.\n\nYes, it sounds like i'm getting the duplicate because I'm re-posting with Ctrl-R, but no: after the first, \"manual\" form submission, I empty the database. Then i repost, I see the firebug Net tab in the attached screenshot, and I have *two* new, identical records.\n\nThis does *not* happen when I do the same in firefox 3.6\n\nReproducible: Always\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Build a form that inserts a record into a dB\n2. Submit it\n3. Empty the dB\n4.
