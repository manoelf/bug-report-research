My settings are:\n\ngrep -i mailto prefs.js \n\nuser_pref(\"network.protocol-handler.app.mailto\", \"/usr/bin/thunderbird --compose %s\");\nuser_pref(\"network.protocol-handler.expose.mailto\", true);\nuser_pref(\"network.protocol-handler.warn-external.mailto\", true);\n\nWhen I click on a MailTo: link, I get the pop up (External Protocol Request)\nthat tells me it is about to start \"/usr/bin/thunderbird --compose %s\".  When\nI click on \"Launch Application\", the box disappears and nothing else happens.\n\nAs a test, I can run \"/usr/bin/thunderbird --compose mailto:foo@foo.com\" from\nthe command line.\n\nPlease let me know how I can assist with this bug.  It may take me three or\nfour days to respond, but I will respond.\n\nMany thanks,\n-T", "attachment_id": null, "creator": "ToddAndMargo@zoho.com"}, {"is_private": false, "creator": "benc@meer.net", "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "wfm on Mac OS X + FF 2.0.0.4.
