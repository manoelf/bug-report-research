Here's a quick review of where we are now, and how we got here.\n\nSignificant Problem: Firefox is taking an extremely long time to load relative to Chrome, because our load time often includes restoring a very large number of tabs.  Chrome just opens.  This effects tS far more than the considerable effort we put into shaving off milliseconds here or there.\n\nProblem: Users don't always know if they need their session in the future because the future isn't now yet.  They may just need Firefox to open immediately so they can quickly perform a task.  They aren't sure, they can't predict the future.\n\nProblem: Some users are choosing to save their session without really knowing what it means, because they were instructed to always save their data, or because saying yes to an unknown question feels safer than saying no.  These users are getting a slow load, and they didn't really want it in the first place.\n\nSolution to all three problems: make session restore opt in on open instead of opt in on close (fixed with bug 593421, to add a very large button to Firefox Start).\n\n---------\n\n*New Problem* (this bug, which we anticipated but didn't have time to solve before shipping): Not everyone has Firefox Start set as their home page, so they don't have access to the opt-in button.\n\nBest solution: Firefox home tab (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Features/Home_Tab )\n\nImmediate solution (this bug): display a notification bar prompting the user if they want to restore their session on launch, if they have customized their home page.", "attachment_id": null, "raw_text": "This is a follow up bug from bug 592822, where we removed the save on quit dialog box.
